We know to keep things clear, concise and simple so that our writing communicates with ease. And we definitely understand the make-or-break importance of an attention-grabbing headline. So\u2026 how do we then structure our content to be persuasive? Good content structure is never written in stone, but persuasive copy will do certain things and contain certain elements time and time again. Whether you\u2019re writing a sales page, long blog post or promotional ebook, the flow will determine effectiveness. Here are some guidelines: First of all, focus on the reader \u2013 make an important promise early on (with your headline and opening paragraphs) that tells the reader what\u2019s in it for her. Never allow readers to question why they are bothering to pay attention. Each separate part of your narrative should have a main idea (something compelling) and a main purpose (to rile up the reader, to counter an opposing view, etc) that supports your bigger point and promise. Don\u2019t digress, and don\u2019t ramble. Stay laser focused. Be ultra-specific in your assertions, and always make sure to give \u201creasons why.\u201d General statements that are unsupported by specific facts cause a reader\u2019s BS detector to go on high alert. Demonstrate large amounts of credibility, using statistics, expert references and testimonials as appropriate. You must be authoritative \u2013 if you\u2019re not an existing expert on a subject, you had better have done your research. After building your credibility and authority, make sure you get back to the most important person around \u2013 the reader. What\u2019s STILL in it for him? Restate the hook and the promise that got readers engaged in the first place. Make an offer. Whether you\u2019re selling a product or selling an idea, you\u2019ve got to explicitly present it for acceptance by the reader. Be bold and firm when you present your offer, and relieve the reader\u2019s risk of acceptance by standing behind what you say. Sum everything up, returning full circle to your original promise and demonstrate how you\u2019ve fulfilled it. These are some of the key elements of persuasive copy. Use them to provide a \u201croadmap\u201d to your writing, and you\u2019ll achieve better results. Go back to the Copywriting 101 series.

Thankfully, they\u2019re doing just fine.NOTES: 30_wounds: #9 Black and blue. (table)Inspired by elandrialore's fic FirstsMerlin cursed the day he'd ever come to Camelot. Why did Arthur send for him at three o'clock in the morning? He may be the prince but that didn't give him the right to demand things from him before dawn.He had sent the sleepy kitchen boy home and pulled on a mismatch of clothes, stumbling out of Gaius' chambers and into the courtyard. The November air was freezing and he hugged himself, glaring at the frost forming on the stone. It was going to be something stupid, he could tell. 'Fetch me feathers, Merlin' or 'find me a donkey, Merlin' \u2013 Arthur was quite ridiculous when drunk. And why else would he be up at this time, if not to drench himself in mead and torment his manservant?He would make him pay for it in the morning - slam the door just after daybreak and throw open the curtains with some chirpy whistling. That would teach him to summon Merlin at such-The first blow came from behind, knocking him to his knees and leaving his head spinning. He felt a kick to his ribs and he hit the floor, as a fist slammed into his face. After that, it was chaos, fists and boots connecting at random, together, everywhere.There was more than one, maybe four, but he had screwed his eyes shut, hoping he'd pass out soon. He tried to remember a defence spell but the next punch to the head wiped it from his mind.Suddenly, he left the ground, his arms twisted painfully behind him as his feet trailed beneath him. A gauntleted hand lifted his chin and he hesitantly opened his eyes. The knight wore full armour, as did the man behind him, and he felt the chill of metal through his shirt on both sides. Four knights. Arthur's knights.\"You, pretty boy, have a lot to answer for.\"\"Wha-?\"Another punch to the gut and he groaned. \"Don't speak to me, pig. You've got the ear of her royal highness now and we don't get a look-in. You, pretty boy, have stolen our court favour.\"Merlin struggled to breath through the pain and the shock. Arthur. This was about Arthur.\"I wonder what he sees in you \u2013 are you a good lay, pretty boy? Tell you what: renounce the prince and we may spare your life. We'll even give you a little\u2026favour ourselves, won't we, men?\"They laughed crudely and Merlin tensed. He pulled away from them and spat blood on the knight's boot. \"Go to Hell.\"The gauntlet tightened on his cheek, scraping the skin. \"What did you say?\"Merlin glared at him. \"I'm the prince's man, always.\"He was gathering the strength for a spell when the two knights hit him at once, knocking the breath out of him and sending him sprawling on the stone. \"I'll teach you respect, pretty boy. Men.\"Hands on his waist and he cried out, but then there was a clatter from the kitchen across the yard. The knights dropped him and fled, leaving him shivering on the ground.He had to get to Arthur. He had to warn him. With a moan, he tried to inch forward but his arm spasmed and he curled into a ball, shaking with pain. Arthur. He had to save Arthur, he thought, as he finally passed out.~Where was Merlin? He'd sent for him over an hour ago \u2013 he couldn't be that incompetent! He'd felt bad for summoning his manservant so late, but his father had sprung this hunting trip on him at dinner and none of his stuff was ready. After a futile attempt to organise it himself, he knew he'd have to involve Merlin \u2013 only he could understand this ridiculous system of storage.He'd have to look for him \u2013 again. This was becoming a regular occurrence. What kind of prince had to look for his manservant? A manservant who didn't even address him correctly? With a shake of his head, he pulled on his cloak and ventured out of his chambers. He would be having serious words when he found him \u2013 he thought 'idiot' would feature quite prominently.When he reached the courtyard, he stopped short, before breaking into a run. It couldn't be\u2026not this crumpled heap in a bloody pool\u2026no\u2026\"Merlin? Merlin!\"He touched the frozen cheek with his fingertips; Merlin flinched away and Arthur drew in a sharp breath. Someone had beaten him and left him for dead. When he found them\u2026With difficulty, he reigned in his anger and, with infinite care, drew Merlin into his arms like a maiden. He flinched again, a low moan leaving his lips, and Arthur stood quickly, marching across the courtyard as if Hell has possessed him.He flung open the door to Gaius' rooms. \"Gaius!\" he shouted. \"Help me!\" He heard the note of desperation in his voice, and when Gaius emerged, equally frightened, he was already laying Merlin on the bed.\"I found him like this in the courtyard. I\u2026don't know how long he's been there, but I sent for him\u2026an hour ago.\"Gaius frowned, but his eyes betrayed his fear. \"These clothes are soaked through. Help me remove them.\"His hands shook as he untied the laces on Merlin's shirt, hauling it over unresisting arms that were bruised and bleeding. Who would do such a thing, and right under the king's nose? He would have to increase patrols in the city at night. He could not let this happen again.Gaius had removed his trousers and wrapped him in a blanket, but Arthur pushed the wool back, tracing a cut on his shoulder as his mouth went dry.\"This was made by a gauntlet,\" he whispered. Gaius tensed beside him.\"Are you sure, sire?\"\"I know the mark.\" He would not be sick. He would not leave. Yet the fury and betrayal coursed through him \u2013 a knight had done this. One of his knights had attacked Merlin.\"His leg is broken \u2013 hold him still while I splint it.\"Arthur nodded, leaning forward to press his shoulders into the pillow. Merlin cried out and tried to twist away; Arthur quickly took hold of his hand, pressing it with his own. \"It's all right, Merlin. It's me.\"The man quietened and Arthur stroked his fingers, fighting back the anguish rising in his chest. \"Will he be all right?\"\"If we can keep infection from his wounds, he will make a full recovery. Provided his head is\u2026\"Gaius trailed off and Arthur brushed his free hand over Merlin's scalp, disturbed by the bumps and cuts he found there. \"He will be fine,\" he said firmly, his voice brokering no argument.\"Hold him now,\" Gaius said, and Arthur pressed again as Merlin practically leapt off the bed, breathing hard. Arthur grasped his shoulders, swinging behind him to support him against his body. \"Easy, Merlin, I've got you.\"He relaxed against Arthur's chest as Gaius finished applying the splint. \"You found me,\" he said wonderingly and Arthur closed his eyes.\"I found you,\" he said, cursing the wobble in his voice. Gaius forced Merlin to drink a potion before continuing his work, applying salves and bandages, stitching cuts where necessary, and trying to reduce the swelling.\"There were four of them,\" Merlin whispered and Arthur's hold on him tightened. \"Arthur, they were-\"\"Knights, I know. I will deal with it,\" he said darkly, tone at odds with the sweep of his thumb over Merlin's wrist.\"They said I'd stolen your favour.\"He was speechless. Merlin had been attacked for being his friend. He was a danger to Merlin, to everyone he was close to \u2013 he would have to distance himself from them, however much it hurt him. He wouldn't see anyone die for him. Especially not Merlin.\"I told them to go to Hell.\"Arthur sighed and leaned on Merlin's shoulder. It seemed it might be difficult to get rid of him after all. \"Merlin, you are an idiot.\"\"So you keep saying,\" Merlin said with a tinge of amusement, before gasping at Gaius' hand on his leg. Arthur held him until the wave of agony had passed and then, reluctantly, lowered him down to the pillow.\"You need to rest,\" he said, before looking up to Gaius. \"Would you fetch my spare sword from Merlin's room?\"\"Sire-\"\"Please, Gaius.\"\"Are you going to watch over me?\" Merlin teased.\"Yes,\" he said bluntly, perching on the edge of the bed. \"Until morning.\"\"You don't have-\"\"Merlin, I'm staying.\"Merlin closed his eyes and a smile tugged at his lips. \"Okay.\"He watched Merlin fall asleep and took the sword from Gaius with a nod. Then, with one hand on the pommel and one on Merlin's shoulder, he commenced his watch.~\"I have called you here for a reason.\"They were all watching him nervously. His jacket was stained with Merlin's blood and they couldn't keep their eyes off it; Morgana had told him to change, as she'd taken his place at Merlin's side, but he had shrugged off her concerns. He would not waste time while such filth pervaded his brotherhood.\"My manservant was attacked in the courtyard last night by four knights of Camelot.\"A ripple of shocked whispers spread through them but he held up his hand.\"I give these\u2026despicable pigs three options. One \u2013 they may fall on their swords before me now.\" There was absolute silence. \"Two \u2013 they may creep out of Camelot by nightfall, like the rats they are. Or three \u2013 they may stay silent and condemn themselves and their brothers to execution by hanging.\"Every knight before him was horrified by his words. In their eyes, this punishment was outlandish \u2013 servants were beaten all the time, for inadequacy or amusement. Yet he was deadly serious and they could read it in his eyes.\"As none of you have stepped forward for death, I will count you tomorrow. I hope what I find does not displease me. Dismissed!\"He watched them leave, his heart heavy. He prayed he would not have kill them in the morning, but he would do anything to keep Merlin safe. Shaking his head, he returned to Gaius' chambers, exhausted. When he staggered through the door, Morgana caught hold of him and guided him to Merlin's room.\"You must rest.\"\"I can't, Morgana. I have the hunt-\"\"I'll tell Uther you're indisposed. Now lie down with Merlin and go to sleep.\"\"Who will watch-\"\"Gwen will be here all day, and I'll leave your sword on the chair.\"With a huff, Arthur sat heavily on Merlin's bed, causing the man to shift onto his side and open his eyes.\"You're back,\" he said sleepily and shuffled over, leaving a space for Arthur to take. The prince reluctantly lay down, waiting for Morgana to shut the door before reaching for Merlin's shoulder.\"How are you feeling?\"\"Like I've been mangled,\" Merlin said hoarsely, offering a lopsided smile. \"You\u2026dealt with it?\"\"It's done,\" he said, absently reaching to trace the bruise on Merlin's cheek. He closed his eyes, lips parted, and Arthur wondered if he could kiss him, show him how much he meant to him, how afraid he'd been.Merlin's breathing evened out and Arthur realised he'd fallen asleep. With a soft sigh, he let his hand fall away from Merlin's face. Tomorrow, then.He moved closer to Merlin, resting his arm over his waist, and closing his eyes. He was his servant's man, and he did not care what anyone thought of it.He had Merlin and that was all that mattered.Podfic by eosroseTags: 30_wounds, fic, merlin \u00a0\u00a0 Current Mood: accomplishedCurrent Music: 'Simmer Down' - The Regulars \u00a0 116 comments | Leave a comment \u00a0 Page 1 of 2<<[1] [2] >> ( 116 comments \u2014 Post a new comment ) lisson17 on November 16th, 2008 04:54 pm (UTC) this was utterly gorgeous! i love protective Arthur and hurted Merlin, it is utter love!thank you for writing this :-) (Reply) (Thread) (Link) demon_faith on November 16th, 2008 04:55 pm (UTC) Protective!Arthur is my favourite kind.Thank you for commenting!

MahZeh Tools Tools > All > April 8th, 2007 Solutions to the IE z-index Bug: CSS The z-index style rule \u2014 seemingly simple at first, suprisingly complicated when you think it through \u2014 is an oft-misunderstood part of the CSS2 specification. In on the misunderstanding, evidently, are key members of the Internet Explorer team at Microsoft. Others before me have documented the IE z-index bug (Anne van Kesteren and Kae Verens among them), but I find it easier to grasp with a live example: A (relative), z-index: 1 2 3 4 none A\u2019 (absolute), z-index: 1 2 3 4 none B (relative), z-index: 1 2 3 4 none B\u2019 (absolute), z-index: 1 2 3 4 none This is a common scenario. Blocks A and B are positioned relative, in order that their children A\u2019 (child of block A) and B\u2019 (child of block B) can be positioned absolute relative to the parents\u2019 boundaries. (The CSS2 specification defines a \u201ccontainer block,\u201d against whose boundaries descendants can be positioned, as having a position other than none.) The blocks are positioned such that they overlap each other. By default, they are drawn in document order, putting A on the bottom because it appears (and is drawn) first in the document, and B\u2019 on top because it appears (and is drawn) last. It only gets sticky when we want the blocks stacked in a different order. Let\u2019s say we want A\u2019 to appear on top of the stack. If we take Mozilla/Firefox\u2019s behavior to represent standards-compliance, then the correct way to accomplish this is to assign a z-index value to A\u2019. Try it. In Mozilla, A\u2019 jumps to the top like we want. In IE, nothing happens. Actually, something does happen, but it\u2019s not what we expect, and it renders no visible effect. It turns out IE doesn\u2019t treat z-index values as all belonging to the same \u201cstack.\u201d Each of the relative-positioned blocks (A and B) is automatically awarded, by IE, its very own internal z-index stack. In other words, setting z-index on either A\u2019 or B\u2019 only affects its stacking order within its relative-positioned containing block. Because A\u2019 and B\u2019 each has a different relative-positioned container, there is no way in IE to specify their z-index stacking orders relative to each other. Only the relative-positioned parents can be z-index stacked relative to each other. (Although, of course, they couldn\u2019t if they were themselves contained within separate relative-positioned containers.) To make A\u2019 stack on top of B\u2019, the only pure CSS solution that works in IE is to set z-index for A\u2019s relative-positioned parent, A. And if we want A\u2019 to stack over B\u2019 without A stacking over B, it seems there is no solution that works in IE at all, short of rearranging markup in the document itself. Solution for Pop-Ups There is a special case of the z-index problem, involving pop-up items, that can only be solved with JavaScript. I have described the problem and the fix here. 2 Responses So Far > April 11th, 2007 > MahZeh.org \u00bb Blog Archive \u00bb Solutions to the IE z-index Bug: JavaScript says: [\u2026] have previous discussed the IE z-index bug and how CSS can, in some situations, be fudged to work around it.

It got its own name and documentation and a new home for the code. Late 2009 QUnit was refactored to be independent of jQuery, making it useful for testing all kinds of JavaScript frameworks and applications. Its assertion methods now follow the CommonJS assert specification. While QUnit can run in server-side or command line environments, it\u2019s still most useful for testing JavaScript in the browser. This article explores how to write unit tests with QUnit, and how QUnit can help developing applications.\u00a0To get started, let\u2019s look at a minimal QUnit testsuite, the Hello World of QUnit: <!DOCTYPE html> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"qunit.css\"> <script src=\"qunit.js\"></script> <script> test(\"hello\", function() { ok(true, \"world\"); }); </script> <h1 id=\"qunit-header\">QUnit Hello World</h1> <h2 id=\"qunit-banner\"></h2> <ol id=\"qunit-tests\"></ol>This is a very minimalistic testsuite. It declares a doctype, includes the CSS and JS files for QUnit, defines another script element with a single QUnit test and assert, and a little bit of additional markup for QUnit to output testresults. The call to the test() function defines a test with the name of \u201chello\u201d. QUnit will then run this test once the page has loaded. The second argument, a function passed to test(), contains the actual testcode to run, here a call to ok(). The first argument defines if the assertion passes or not, the second specifies a message to output. In this case, the boolean true will always pass, as we\u2019re not yet testing anything really.If we open this as a html file in a browser, we\u2019ll see this output:We can now set the assertion to always fail: test(\"hello\", function() { ok(false, \"world\"); });The result will be this:Now we see the hello test failing, along with the failing assertion. You\u2019ll also notice in the screenshot the noglobals and notrycatch checkboxes and the text Rerun next to the testname. These are actually interactive elements. We\u2019ll get to these later. For now, let\u2019s write some actual tests.Writing QUnit TestsLet\u2019s look at a more complete example: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>QUnit Test</title> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"qunit.css\"> <script src=\"qunit.js\"></script> <script src=\"tests.js\"></script> </head> <body> <h1 id=\"qunit-header\">QUnit Test</h1> <h2 id=\"qunit-banner\"></h2> <div id=\"qunit-testrunner-toolbar\"></div> <h2 id=\"qunit-userAgent\"></h2> <ol id=\"qunit-tests\"></ol> <div id=\"qunit-fixture\">test markup</div> </body> </html>We\u2019ve added html, head and body elements, referenced an additional .js file and added some more markup for QUnit to interact with. The content of tests.js is this: function format(string, values) { for (var key in values) { string = string.replace(new RegExp(\"\\{\" + key + \"}\"), values[key]); } return string; } test(\"basics\", function() { var values = { name: \"World\" }; equal( format(\"Hello, {name}\", values), \"Hello, World\", \"single use\" ); equal( format(\"Hello, {name}, how is {name} today?\", values), \"Hello, World, how is World today?\", \"multiple\" ); });We\u2019re now testing a function called format, which expects a string template and an object with keys and values to replace within that template.The test for that function uses the equal() assertion. It compares the first two arguments using JavaScript\u2019s \u201c==\u201d operator. The first argument is the actual value, in this case being the output of calling format(). The second argument is the expected value; the formatted string.Running it in the browser produces this:As we can see, the implementation actually has a bug as it doesn\u2019t replace a single key multiple times. Using the equal() assertion makes this easy to spot as we see both the actual and the expected value, a diff between the two, and (depending on the browser you use, works fine in Firefox and Chrome), even filename and line number of the bad assertion. Line 13 points to the second equal() assertion.We can easily fix that issue by passing the global flag to the RegExp constructor: new RegExp(\"\\{\" + key + \"}\", \"g\")With that modification, both assertions pass. We could now extend the testsuite by also writing a test that involves a template with more than one key. Give that a try if you want. Up next: How to avoid one test breaking other tests.AtomicAs long as we test only functions with no side effects, testing is really easy. It gets more trickier when code has side effects such as modifying the DOM, or introducing or modifying global variables. It\u2019s certainly a reasonable goal to write code free of side effects, as that has advantages beyond just testing, but it\u2019s not always possible. To keep tests atomic - independent of each other - QUnit provides a few tools that you can use.DOM fixtureFor tests that modify the DOM, we can use the #qunit-fixture element. We can put static markup in there and have each test use that or we can leave it empty and have each test append the elements it needs, without having to worry about removing them. QUnit will automatically reset the innerHTML property of the #qunit-fixture element after each test to the initial value. If jQuery is available, QUnit uses jQuery\u2019s html() method instead, which also cleans up jQuery event handlers.If we want to test a HTML5 placeholder polyfill, we\u2019d start with an input element and a placeholder attribute: <div id=\"qunit-fixture\"> <input id=\"input\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"placeholder text\" /> </div>Now each test could select the #input element, modify it, and QUnit would reset it afterwards.moduleIf we need more cleanup than just resetting the DOM, we can do that as part of each test. If we end up with multiple tests having to do the same cleanup, we can refactor that using the module() method. The primary purpose of module() is for grouping tests, e.g. multiple tests that test a specific method can be part of a single module. That helps when filtering tests (see Developing with QUnit below). For making tests atomic, we can use the setup and teardown callbacks module() provides: module(\"core\", { setup: function() { // runs before each test }, teardown: function() { // runs after each test } }); test(\"basics\", function() { // test something });The setup callback is run before each test in this module, teardown is run after each test.We can also use these callbacks to create objects and use them within tests, without having to rely on closures (or global variables) to pass them to the test. That works as both setup and teardown and the actual tests are called within a custom scope that is shared and cleaned up automatically.Here\u2019s some code to test a simple (and incomplete) library for handling monetary values: var Money = function(options) { this.amount = options.amount || 0; this.template = options.template || \"{symbol}{amount}\"; this.symbol = options.symbol || \"$\"; }; Money.prototype = { add: function(toAdd) { this.amount += toAdd; }, toString: function() { return this.template .replace(\"{symbol}\", this.symbol) .replace(\"{amount}\", this.amount) } }; Money.euro = function(amount) { return new Money({ amount: amount, template: \"{amount} {symbol}\", symbol: \"EUR\" }); };The code creates an object Money, with one default constructor for dollars, a factory method for euros, and two methods for manipulating and printing. Instead of creating new Money objects for each test, we use the setup callback to create objects and store them in the test scope: module(\"Money\", { setup: function() { this.dollar = new Money({ amount: 15.5 }); this.euro = Money.euro(14.5); }, teardown: function() { // could use this.dollar and this.euro for cleanup } }); test(\"add\", function() { equal( this.dollar.amount, 15.5 ); this.dollar.add(16.1) equal( this.dollar.amount, 31.6 ); }); test(\"toString\", function() { equal( this.dollar.toString(), \"$15.5\" ); equal( this.euro.toString(), \"14.5 EUR\" ); });Here two objects are created and stored on setup. The add test uses just one of them, the toString test uses both.The teardown callback isn\u2019t necessary here, as there\u2019s no need to remove the created Money objects.Testing asynchronous codeWe\u2019ve seen that QUnit controls when to actually run tests, and that works fine as long as your code runs synchronously. Once code under test requires usage of asynchronous callbacks (e.g. due to timeouts or AJAX requests), you need to give QUnit feedback about that so that it stops running the next test and waits for you to tell it to go on.The methods for that are simply called stop() and start(). Here\u2019s an example: test(\"async\", function() { stop(); $.getJSON(\"resource\", function(result) { deepEqual(result, { status: \"ok\" }); start(); }); });Here jQuery\u2019s $.getJSON method is used to request data from a resource and then assert the result. For that deepEqual is used (instead of the previous equal), to check that the result is exactly what we expect.As $.getJSON is asynchronous, we call stop(), then run the code, and at the end of the callback, call start() to tell QUnit to continue running tests.Running asynchronous code without telling QUnit to stop would cause arbitrary results like failed (or passed) assertions showing up in other tests.asyncTestWe can drop the call to stop() and use asyncTest() instead of test(). That makes it more obvious that a test runs asynchronous: asyncTest(\"async2\", function() { $.getJSON(\"resource\", function(result) { deepEqual(result, { status: \"ok\" }); start(); }); });expectWhen testing callbacks, asynchronous or not, we can\u2019t be sure if our callback will actually get called at some point. For that we can use expect(), to define the number of assertions we expect within a test. That way we can avoid a test that passes with just one good assertion, when there should\u2019ve been two assertions. asyncTest(\"async3\", function() { expect(1); $.getJSON(\"resource\", function(result) { deepEqual(result, { status: \"ok\" }); start(); }); });Here, within an asyncTest, expect is called with an argument of 1, telling QUnit that this test should finish with exactly one assertion. When dealing with multiple asynchronous tests, adding the expect call makes sense even if there is just one code path for the test. If another test is broken and leaks assertions into this test, the expect call helps catching that problem.async semaphoreIf a test has multiple potential endpoints - multiple callbacks that run in random order - we can use QUnit\u2019s built-in semaphore. By calling stop() as often as you call start() later on, QUnit will only continue to run once the internal counter increased by stop() is decreased back to zero by start(). test(\"async semaphore\", function() { stop(); stop(); $.getJSON(\"resource\", function(result) { equal(result.status, \"ok\"); start(); }); $.getJSON(\"resource\", function(result) { equal(result.status, \"ok\"); start(); }); });More assertionsSo far we\u2019ve seen ok, equal and deepEqual in use. But QUnit provides a few more assertions. There\u2019s strictEqual, which works the same as equal, except that it uses strict comparisons via JavaScript\u2019s \u201c===\u201d operator. When comparing values of potentially different types, e.g. numbers and strings, it makes sense to use strictEqual, so that you don\u2019t end up with a test where 0 equals \"0\" (the number zero vs the string zero).For equal, deepEqual and strictEqual there are inverted counterparts: notEqual, notDeepEqual, and notStrictEqual. The same rules apply, it\u2019s just the result that gets inverted.raisesIn addition to these, there\u2019s the raises assertion (similar to throws in the CommonJS spec, but not using a reserved keyword). You pass a function as the first argument, which will get called by QUnit within a try-catch block. If the function throws an exception, the assertion passes, otherwise fails. You can also test the thrown exception using the second argument. It accepts a regular expression to test the exception, a constructor function to test with instanceof, or just a function that gets the exception passed as the first argument and returns a boolean for valid or invalid results. test(\"raises\", function() { function CustomError() {} raises(function() { throw new CustomError(); }, CustomError, \"must throw error to pass\"); });The example shows how to use raises along with testing for the constructor of the thrown exception, by passing a reference to the expected constructor as the second argument.Custom assertionsIt\u2019s common for assertions to require more than just a call to equal(). A good way of refactoring test code is to extract custom assertion methods. To make the output consistent with other assertions, you can use QUnit.push() directly. Here\u2019s an example, from the jQuery UI testsuite: function domEqual( selector, modifier, message ) { var attributes = [\"class\", \"role\", \"id\", \"tabIndex\", \"aria-activedescendant\"]; function extract(value) { var result = {}; result.nodeName = value[0].nodeName; $.each(attributes, function(index, attr) { result[attr] = value.attr(attr); }); result.children = []; var children = value.children(); if (children.length) { children.each(function() { result.children.push(extract($(this))); }); } else { result.text = value.text(); } return result; } var expected = extract($(selector)); modifier($(selector)); var actual = extract($(selector)); QUnit.push( QUnit.equiv(actual, expected), actual, expected, message ); }This method is used by tests to verify that the destroy-method is properly implemented, leaving the element after calling destroy in the same state as it was before it was initialized. It replaces comparing the innerHTML property, as that produced way too many false negatives. Instead this method uses a list of attributes to compare, and recursively goes through all child elements, getting the text content of elements without children.At the end, the two results are compared using QUnit.equiv, the deep comparsion implmentation used by deepEquals. Both the actual and expected results are also passed to QUnit.push, along with forwarding the message argument. By using QUnit.push directly, QUnit can output correct file names and line numbers. If we used deepEqual instead, the line number would point to our custom assertion calling deepEqual, instead of the code calling the custom assertion.Here\u2019s an example from the jQuery UI autocomplete testsuite for using the method: test(\"destroy\", function() { domEqual(\"#autocomplete\", function() { $(\"#autocomplete\").autocomplete().autocomplete(\"destroy\"); }); })The custom assertion method is called with a selector and a callback. The selector specifies what element to test; the callback does the actual modification. The assertion method takes snapshots before and after applying the modifier, then comparing the result.Developing with QUnitBetween writing tests we spend a lot of time looking at test results, trying to figure out why a particular test failed to run or why a test that was supposed to fail passed instead.QUnit provides tools that help at this step. We\u2019ve already seen the detailed test output that includes actual and expected values, a diff between the two and file names and line numbers.When working on one particular test, it helps to rerun only that test instead of the full testsuite. It can make a difference in the time to run the tests (less tests = less time), but it can also help to focus on one particular issue when there are other unrelated failing tests.To rerun a single test, click on the Rerun link next to the name of the test. It\u2019ll open the same testsuite again, but adding a \u201c?filter=name-of-test\u201d to the URL. The name will be URL-encoded, so may look a bit odd. The useful part of having the address change is that you can just reload the page to test again with the same filter, or navigate back to run the full testsuite.Here the QUnit testsuite is filtered to run only the raises test from the assertions module.You can also modify the address manually. If we set filter=assertions, the testsuite will run all the tests that contain \u201cassertions\u201d in their name:Debugging toolsWe\u2019ve seen the noglobals and notrycatch checkboxes in the QUnit header. Clicking those sets a special filter.noglobalsWhen noglobals is checked, QUnit enumerates all properties on the window object before running a test, and then compares that list to the window object after finishing the current test. If there\u2019s a difference, the test fails, with an additional assertion outputting the introduced or missing global property. This makes it easy to spot global variables that are introduced by accident.If we modify our first test and remove the var keyword in front of the values variable, then rerun the testsuite with noglobals checked, we get this:Sometimes code has to introduce global variables; therefore the feature is off by default. But it can help to spot mistakes by enabling it every once in a while.notrycatchThe other checkbox is notrycatch. This tells QUnit to run test callbacks outside of the usual try-catch block. When a test fails with an exception, QUnit won\u2019t be able to catch it, therefore the testsuite will stop running. This becomes useful when debugging a particular exception, epsecially in browsers with poor built-in JavaScript debugging tools. Especially in IE6, an unhandled exception provides much more useful information then a catched exception. Even if rethrown, due to JavaScripts rather poor exception handling, the original stacktrace is lost in most browsers.This is obviously a very special-purpose tool. But once you are hit by an exception that you can\u2019t trace back to actual code, this can be extremely useful.More efficient TDDQUnit is a great tool for test-driven development (TDD, see\u00a0other\u00a0Script\u00a0Junkie\u00a0articles) as-is, but with a little tweak it becomes even more useful in providing useful results much faster.Consider a larger testsuite that takes ten seconds to run. A test somewhere at the end fails after a change you did, correctly so. You implement the missing functionality, rerun the test, wait ten seconds for the result, and still get a failure. Ten seconds can easily become 30 seconds, 1 minute or worse. But even with 10 seconds per run, TDD is starting to fall apart. Running just parts of the testsuite using filters isn\u2019t always an option, as you want verification that you didn\u2019t break anything else with your change. Optimizing a testsuite to run faster can be a challenge in itself, as it\u2019s hard to tell if a change to the testsuite actually breaks something.What you can do here is check the \u201cHide passed tests\u201d checkbox. Once checked, QUnit won\u2019t show any tests it currently runs or that passed, instead you\u2019ll see only failing tests.With that in place, another QUnit feature becomes much more obvious and useful. Under the hood, QUnit keeps track of which tests, in a previous run, failed. It uses sessionStorage for that, if supported (in pretty much every modern browser). The next time you run the suite, it\u2019ll run the failing tests first, while maintaining the same output order. Without \u201cHide passed tests\u201d checked, that is usually not obvious, as the failing test gets lost somewhere in the long list of passing tests. But once checked, passed tests and the \u201cRunning test [...]\u201d placeholders are hidden.With that, rerunning the 10-second suite will instantly output the result of the failing test, and we can go ahead and continue working on the code. Once we come back we can still check the end result of the run to see if there were any additional failures. If not, we just reload to run again, and get instant feedback on the test we care about.Testing multiple jQuery versionsIf you\u2019re building jQuery plugins or some other form of library or framework that you want to test against multiple versions of a dependency, here\u2019s a useful technique to do that without requiring any modifications of your files or serverside code. Instead of referencing jQuery directly, create a script that checks the query string and then loads the specified jQuery version. Scott Gonz\u00e1lez came up with this technique for the AmplifyJS testsuite. Here\u2019s a slightly modified version used the by Validation Plugin: (function() { var parts = document.location.search.slice( 1 ).split( \"&\" ), length = parts.length, i = 0, current, version = \"\"; for ( ; i < length; i++ ) { current = parts[ i ].split( \"=\" ); if ( current[ 0 ] === \"jquery\" ) { version = current[ 1 ]; break; } } if (version) { version = \"-\" + version; } document.write( \"<script src='../lib/jquery\" + version + \".js'></script>\" ); })();The actual script include happens synchronously with document.write, which works fine in this context.In order to easily rerun the testsuite with these different versions, the plugin\u2019s testsuite adds a few links to the header:That way it becomes a matter of clicking a few links to run the same suite against multiple versions of jQuery. The same technique could be applied to test against other dependencies as well.ConclusionWe\u2019ve seen how QUnit provides the tools both for writing and refactoring tests, and developing frameworks and applications more efficiently. Even if you end up using a different testing tool, you should look out for the described features, as they make testing much more efficient. J\u00f6rn is a Java engineer living in Cologne, Germany. He\u2019s a Development Lead and contributed his accordion and autocomplete plugins to jQuery UI. He has also been a driving force of the jQuery core development process, pushing out many of the 1.0.x releases.

Posted on March 24, 2011 by Alex Miles Younger in Pixels Staring at the sky Posted on March 16, 2011 by Alex Miles Younger in Prose Ides of March Today is the Ides of March. 2054 years ago today, Julius Caesar was stabbed to death 23 times on the floor of the Roman Senate. The murder was dramatized in Shakespeare\u2019s Julius Caesar, and as a result the phrase \u201cbeware the Ides of March\u201d is stuck in my head. There was no seer in real life warning Caesar, it was just a useful addition to the plot of Shakespeare\u2019s play. Also, the warning was for the Roman dictator, not me. Nevertheless, each year I still feel like the warning might also be for me. It makes me wonder who else is affected (however slightly) on the Ides of March. What\u2019s the psychic impact of a \u201ccursed\u201d day? Is our behavior subconsciously affected by marking the anniversary of bloodshed? Do the 7 billion* of us on the planet act differently because we\u2019re told to beware this day? Even a little? What\u2019s the impact of 7 billion people expecting today to be a bad day? Do we start to notice bad things because our filter is set to expect them? Do we start to do bad things because we expect them to happen? Is being convinced of a superstition like this a self-fulfilling prophecy? * Yes, I realize not all 7 billion of us know about the Ides of March. Also, yes, I realize the hypothetical troubles of March fifteenth pale in comparison to the very real troubles in Japan.

Working Together: SQL Server 2008 R2 Reporting Services Integration in SharePoint 2010Alan Le MarquandSQL Server and SharePoint have always worked together well. When SharePoint Server 2010 and SQL Server 2008 R2 were released, there were some significant improvements to the integration between SharePoint and SQL Server 2008 R2 Reporting Services (SSRS). Here\u2019s a look at how to configure and use the latest enhancements.Server Integration ArchitectureThe Reporting Services Add-in for SharePoint is what truly drives the integration between the two servers. You install the add-in, which is available as a free download on all SharePoint 2010 Web Front End (WFE) servers that require integration with a Report Server. Figure 1 shows the architecture of the integration components.On the SharePoint 2010 WFE, the add-in installs three components: the SSRS Proxy, a Report Viewer Web Part, and the application pages that allow you to view, store, and manage report server content on a SharePoint site or farm. The SSRS Proxy facilitates communication between the WFE and the Report Server. On the Central Administration Reporting Services pages within SharePoint, you configure the proxy with the Report Server you want to access, as well as the authentication method and credentials to access the server. For the integration to work, you must configure the Report Server to run in SharePoint Integrated mode.Figure 1 Server Integration ArchitectureOne item to note in Figure1 is the SharePoint Object Model component on the Report Server. For the Report Server to understand the reporting information stored in SharePoint and to be able to secure it, the Report Server has to interact with the configuration and content databases on your SharePoint site or farm. You can achieve this by installing a minimum copy of SharePoint on the Report Server and joining it to the farm.The version of SharePoint you install on the Report Server must be the same as the version used throughout the farm. \u00a0You need to do this only if you\u2019re running your Report Server on a separate machine. If you are running both SharePoint and Reporting Services on the same machine, you only need to install the add-in.Configuring IntegrationOverall, configuring integration has been simplified with SharePoint 2010 and SQL Server 2008 R2. The order in which you perform the configuration depends on what you\u2019ve already installed. Even if you\u2019re starting from scratch or from an existing installation, the key is to have all the main components installed before you configure the SSRS Proxy in SharePoint. For best results when integrating SQL Server Reporting Service 2008 R2 with SharePoint 2010, the recommended order if starting from scratch is:Run the SharePoint 2010 prerequisite installer\u2014this will install the SSRS 2008 R2 Add-in for SharePoint.Install and configure SharePoint 2010 in a farm configuration.Repeat steps 1 and 2 on the Report Server machine if it is separate from the SharePoint WFE machine, and configure it to join the SharePoint farm created in step 2.Install SQL Server Reporting Services in SharePoint Integrated mode.Configure the SSRS Proxy via the Reporting Services Integration page and activate the Reporting Services feature.\u00a0\u00a0If you don\u2019t see the Reporting Services content types in your site under the Document| New menu, you\u2019ll need to manually add them. I describe how to add the Report Server Content types later in this article under Integration with Report Builder 3.0.In this scenario, I\u2019d use the SQL Server for the SharePoint database, rather than the embedded edition that SharePoint defaults to. If you plan to install all the components on one machine, step 5 is redundant. Steps 1 and 2 can be combined within the SQL Server installation process.If you have an existing SharePoint installation, you can download and install the add-in at any time. The add-in installation process adds the necessary pages to the SharePoint Central Administration as well as the new Report Server content types for existing SharePoint Libraries in sites using the Business Intelligence (BI) Center site template.On the SharePoint side, you can configure integration on either SharePoint Server 2010 or SharePoint Foundation 2010. Both support the installation of the Reporting Services Add-in. If you install SharePoint and Reporting Services on different machines, you must install the same version of SharePoint on the Report Server. For example, you would not be able to install SharePoint Foundation 2010 on the Report Server if you were using SharePoint Server 2010 as your Web Front End.The add-in installation is very simple; besides entering you name and company, no other configuration is required. If you\u2019re installing SharePoint for the first time, you install the add-in before you install SharePoint; this is done automatically when you run the SharePoint 2010 prerequisite.Configuring the Report Server is straightforward. The key considerations are:The edition of SQL Server has to be Standard, Enterprise or higher.The Report Server database must be created for SharePoint Integrated mode.If you are using separate machines for SharePoint and Report Server, you\u2019ll need a minimal installation of SharePoint and this must be joined to the farm on the Report Server.A Report Server is implemented as a single Windows service that runs under a built-in account or a local or domain Windows user account. In SharePoint Integrated mode, the Report Server service account is provisioned appropriately to access to the SharePoint configuration and content database as well as SharePoint object model resources. This happens when configuring the Reporting Services integration with SharePoint via the Reporting Services Integration page.When the authentication mode is \u201cWindows Integrated,\u201d the Windows user logged into SharePoint will be impersonated when connecting from the WFE to the Report Server. When the authentication mode is a trusted account, the SharePoint user context of the user logged into SharePoint is passed on to Report Server in the form of the SharePoint user token. The SharePoint WFE\u2019s application pool account is used to make the connection from the WFE to Report Server. You\u2019ll find a summary of the Service Account Configuration in the TechNet article \u201cConfiguring Reporting Services for SharePoint 2010 Integration.\u201dIf you\u2019ve already installed Reporting Services using the default settings, the Reporting Services database will be in Native mode. To operate in SharePoint Integrated mode, you\u2019ll need to return to the Reporting Services Configuration tool and, from the Database Settings page, change the mode from Native to SharePoint Integrated.\u00a0You can change the Report Server mode from Native to SharePoint Integrated at any time; however, this does not convert the existing database. Each time you switch you must either create a new database or connect to an existing one.Before configuring the Reporting Services Proxy options within SharePoint, there\u2019s one other configuration you need to make. You should ensure anonymous access has not been enabled on the Web application. While this will not stop you from configuring the Reporting Services Proxy settings, your users will get an error when they run reports. You can choose to use Windows or any claims-based authentication fromthe other authentication providers, and if you are configuring integration between a report server and a SharePoint farm, each SharePoint Web application in the farm can be configured to use different authentication providers.The Add-in creates a new Reporting Services section within the SharePoint Central Administration General Application Settings page. On the Reporting Services Integration page you enter the Report Server URL and the authentication details and activation of the Reporting Services feature on all or selective site collections in the farm.Figure 2 Configuring the Reporting Services ProxyOnce you complete the page shown in Figure 2, the integration configuration process is complete.Integration with Report Builder 3.0The main benefit of the integration between SharePoint and Reporting Services is that it allows users to create, modify and publish reports from within SharePoint. Reporting Services provides some predefined content types that are used to manage various files, including the shared Report data source (.rsds) files, the Report Builder model (.smdl), and the Report Builder report definition (.rdl) files. After you have configured integration to allow users to create and manage these new content types from the ribbon and the context menus, you need to enable the new content types on those libraries.If you are using the BI Center site template, you do not have to do anything; the content types are automatically enabled with the template and for all sites created using this template. For all other sites and document libraries, you\u2019ll need to carry out a two-step configuration process. First, you need to enable Content Type Management within the libraries; by default it is off. Then you need to enable the content types for the library. To enable content type management for a document library, follow the procedure in the TechNet article \u201cHow to: Add Report Server Content Types to a Library (Reporting Services in SharePoint Integrated Mode).\u201dOnce these new content types have been added to a library, three new options will appear from the New Document drop-down on the Documents tab. If you now select the Report Builder Report option, Report Builder 3.0 will be downloaded to the client and run. You can alter this behavior from the SharePoint Central Administration. The Reporting Services Server Defaults allows you to turn off this option as well as configure an alternate URL for Report Builder.Using the Report Viewer Web Part on a SharePoint SiteThe Report Viewer Web Part is a custom Web Part that is installed by the Reporting Services Add-in. You can use the Web Part to view, navigate, print and export reports on a report server. To add this Web Part to a page, you can use the steps in the TechNet article \u201cHow to: Add the Report Viewer Web Part to a Web Page (Reporting Services in SharePoint Integrated Mode).\u201dEach Report Viewer Web Part renders one report at a time based on the absolute URL to the report file (.rdl) specified in the Report property. The URL must be the fully qualified path to a report on the current SharePoint site or on a site within the same Web application or farm. The URL must resolve to a document library or to a folder within a document library that contains the report. The report URL must include the .rdl file extension. If the report depends on a model or shared data source files, you don\u2019t need to specify those files in the URL. The report contains references to the files it needs.Claims Authentication and Reporting ServicesOne of the new features introduced with SharePoint Server 2010 is support for claims-based authentication. In claims-aware applications, clients present \u201cclaims\u201d to the application. These claims are pieces of information about the user, such as user name, e-mail address, or manager name. This provides the application with more information than it would receive using Kerberos. Take, for example, a purchasing application: Two of the claims passed to the application could be the user\u2019s manager\u2019s e-mail address and the user\u2019s purchasing limit. In a non-claims-aware application, this information would have to be managed by the application.In the SharePoint world, claims authentication solves the problem of sharing SharePoint sites across organizations. Using a product like Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), two organizations with different authentication methods can set up claims that allow SharePoint to identify a user and assign the correct permissions.Because this functionality is built into SharePoint 2010 products, Reporting Services can work with this authentication model. Reporting Services is not claims-aware; instead it communicates with SharePoint through a trusted account. The proxy service within the SQL Server 2008 R2 add-in uses the SharePoint object model to convert the claims token into a corresponding SharePoint user context in the form of a SharePoint user token that the Report Server can understand and use to validate against the SharePoint database. In a nutshell, the process works like this:SharePoint performs the appropriate claims authentication and, using the SharePoint Secure Token Service, communicates the claims token to the Reporting Services proxy.The Reporting Services proxy then uses the claims token to communicate with the SharePoint object model and generate a corresponding SharePoint user token that it forwards to the Report Server.The Report Server uses the SharePoint user token against the local SharePoint object model to generate the correct SharePoint user context.If the user has the required permission, Report Server sends the requested information back to SharePoint using the appropriate SharePoint user context as it would normally.Native List ReportingSQL Server 2008 R2 Reporting Services now supports SharePoint lists as a data source. This support allows you to retrieve list data from SharePoint Foundation 2010, SharePoint Server 2010, Windows SharePoint Services 3.0, and Office SharePoint Server 2007. The ability to access list data is not reliant on the add-in or running Report Server in Native or SharePoint Integrated mode. The functionality is built into Report Server. What changes in the different configurations is the method of access.There are two methods by which SharePoint list data is accessed. One is via the lists.asmx web service and the other is via the SharePoint object model APIs. On any SharePoint installation, if you enter the URL http://<sharepoint_server_name>\\lists.asmx, you\u2019ll get an XML list of all the lists on the SharePoint site that you\u2019re able to access. By using this method, Report Builder 3.0 is able to retrieve the lists. A Report Server configured in Native mode also uses this method.The SharePoint object model API method can be used in two scenarios. One is where a Report Server is configured in SharePoint Integration mode and the list exists in the same SharePoint farm Reporting Services is integrated with, and this is all on the same machine; remember that in this scenario there is a copy of SharePoint running on the Report Server that gives it access to the API set. The other scenario is where you have SharePoint 2010 installed along with the add-in, but you have no Report Server. This is called local mode and is covered later in the section \u201cReporting Without Reporting Services.\u201dTo use data obtained from a SharePoint list within a report first requires you create a data source, then a dataset that uses that data source. In Report Builder 3.0, there is a new connection type on the Data Source properties page called Microsoft SharePoint List, as shown in Figure 3. Along with this option, you enter the URL of your SharePoint site\u2014no need to add lists.asmx to the URL. The data source can also be configured with different credentials to use when accessing the SharePoint server.Figure3 SharePoint List Connection TypeWhen you create a new dataset based on this data source, you will be given a list of all the SharePoint lists on the site you have access to. You can then drill down into a list and access the individual list items, create filters, create parameters and create reports just as if this were a SQL database table.Alternate Access Mapping SupportAnother integration enhancement is support for Alternate Access Mapping (AAM). AAM has been in SharePoint since the 2007 version, but Reporting Services did not support it. Now if you configure an alternate access mapping within SharePoint Central Administration, the Reporting Service Add-in will maintain the URL structure, as shown in the very simple report in Figure 4. Both http://sql-01 and http://www.contoso.com render the same report.Figure 4 Alternate Access MappingReporting Without Reporting ServicesSo far, all the information in this article has pertained to what is called connected mode. In the previous versions of Reporting Services, this was the only mode available and meant that SharePoint had to be connected to a Reporting Services report server configured in SharePoint Integrated mode in order to render reports using the Report Viewer.With the release of SQL Server 2008 R2, you can render reports without integrating your SharePoint site or farm with a Reporting Services report server. Instead, you can use the Report Viewer to directly render reports from SharePoint when the data extension supports local mode reporting. Out of the box, only the SharePoint List and the Microsoft Access 2010 reporting extension support this.When you\u2019re in local mode, you can also render a report that has an embedded data source or a shared data source from an .rsds file. However, you can\u2019t manage the report or its associated data source as this is not supported in local mode.Supported Combinations of the SharePoint Add-in and Report ServerWith the release of SQL Server 2008 R2 and SharePoint Server 2010, there are now three versions of SQL, three versions of the add-in, and two versions of SharePoint. The integration components can work on any of these releases, but you have to mix and match the right versions. The table in Figure 5 provides the supported combinations of products.Figure 5 Supported Combinations of the SharePoint Add-in and Report Server\u00a0Alan Le Marquand\u00a0is an IT Pro Content Architect for Microsoft based in the United Kingdom.

Mar 29 2011 Lemony Kale Pasta Posted in Healthy, Main Dish, Pasta, Quick/Weeknight Meals, Vegetarian I\u2019m excited that I\u2019ve been finding more ways to incorporate kale into our diets. \u00a0Recently I posted the spicy kale lasagna that we enjoyed to the very last bite. \u00a0Here, kale shines mixed with whole grain pasta and a very simple lemon-olive oil dressing. \u00a0This simple dish is quick and easy to throw together, and takes no longer to prepare than it takes to cook the pasta. \u00a0Jenny was exactly right when she described the sauce as being reminiscent of a Caesar dressing. \u00a0The flavors are indeed very similar and the only thing missing is the anchovies. \u00a0As a Caesar lover, it\u2019s no surprise I loved this dish. \u00a0The original recipe calls for black kale (aka dino or lacinato kale) which is supposed to be more delicate. \u00a0Unfortunately the only organic kale at my store was red kale but it seemed to work just fine. \u00a0I\u2019ll keep my eye out for the black variety to try in the future. Lemony Kale Pasta Printer-Friendly Version Ingredients: For the dressing: 2 cloves garlic, peeled \u00bd tsp. kosher salt, divided \u00bd cup finely grated Parmesan cheese 5-6 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil Juice of 2 lemons \u00bc-\u00bd tsp. red pepper flakes Freshly ground black pepper, to taste For the pasta: 1 lb. whole grain pasta, such as penne 1 large bunch kale (black/lacinato kale preferred), rinsed and dried, stems removed Lemon slices, for garnish Additional Parmesan, for serving Directions: Bring a large pot of water to boil for the pasta. \u00a0Meanwhile, make the dressing. \u00a0Mince the garlic cloves. \u00a0Sprinkle the minced garlic with\u00a0\u00bc teaspoon of the kosher salt and smash the garlic into a paste with a fork or the side of a chef\u2019s knife. \u00a0Transfer the garlic paste to a small bowl. \u00a0Add in the Parmesan, olive oil, lemon juice, red pepper flakes and black pepper. \u00a0Whisk together until well combined. Cook the pasta in the boiling water according to the package directions. \u00a0Chop the kale into\u00a0\u00bd-inch ribbons. \u00a0Add the kale to a large bowl and toss with the dressing to coat well. \u00a0When the pasta is finished, drain well and let cool a minute or two. \u00a0Toss the pasta with the kale and dressing until well coated. \u00a0Serve with sliced lemon and additional Parmesan as desired.

That combo is awesome. Cheers, RosaMarch 29, 2011 \u2013 5:06 am [Reply] Katrina - I absolutely LOVE kale! It\u2019s so healthy, and I love finding new ways to use it. Great recipe!March 29, 2011 \u2013 7:27 am [Reply] StephenC - This is an inspiring dish. One caveat: I can\u2019t stand whole grain pasta. My partner and I find the Barilla Plus pastas are a fine compromise (it\u2019s about 50/50 whole grain versus regular. Nonetheless, I\u2019ll look into adapting your plan to our needs. Thanks.March 29, 2011 \u2013 7:56 am [Reply] StephenC - I just wrote a comment but don\u2019t know what happened to it. Aside from preferring Barilla Plus to whole grain pastas, it occurs to me that a number of different greens would work with this; for example, beet greens or chard. It sounds good enough for me to steal your recipe.March 29, 2011 \u2013 8:00 am [Reply] J3nn (Jenn\u2019s Menu and Lifestyle Blog) - I\u2019ve never seen kale with pretty purple veins like that. This dish looks so delicious. I love kale! I\u2019ve never had it with pasta, though. I\u2019m sure I\u2019d enjoy it. March 29, 2011 \u2013 8:17 am [Reply] Eat Good 4 Life - Whole wheat pasta, kale and lemon? right up my alley although I have never thought about mixing kale and pasta together, interesting. I actually have a bag of kale in the fridge that didn\u2019t know what to do with so perhaps I will try this one March 29, 2011 \u2013 8:17 am [Reply] Liz @ Tip Top Shape - Such a simple and delicious looking recipe!!

Da mucha rabia cuando a uno se le olvidan peque\u00f1os detalles de qu\u00e9 es lo que cen\u00f3 la noche anterior, d\u00f3nde ha dejado el coche aparcado o se le vence el pago de un recibo porque se le fue totalmente de la cabeza. Ahora imaginaos a una persona incapaz de olvidar hasta el m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo detalle. Alguien que tiene el don de recordar fechas concretas de su vida, a pesar de que hayan pasado quiz\u00e1s m\u00e1s de 30 a\u00f1os. En la actualidad, se han censado a seis personas \u2018dotadas\u2019 con una prodigiosa memoria autobiogr\u00e1fica; un s\u00edndrome llamado Hipermnesia (Hyperthymesia). Brad Williams, hipermnesico conocido con el sobrenombre de \"The Human Google\" El t\u00e9rmino Hipermnesia proviene del griego y su traducci\u00f3n ser\u00eda \u201cexceso de recuerdo\u201d (Hiper: exceso \u2013 Mnesia: recuerdo). El 9 de mayo de 2008, los neurocient\u00edficos James McGaugh y Larry Cahill de la Universidad californiana de Ivirne (UCI) publicaron un importante y premiado estudio en el que se profundizaba en el s\u00edndrome y daba claros ejemplos de pruebas realizadas a personas que actualmente padecen de hipermnesia. En el momento de realizar dicho trabajo de investigaci\u00f3n, dos eran las personas localizadas en Estados Unidos con dicha facultad. Desde entonces y hasta la fecha se han sumado cuatro m\u00e1s, la \u00faltima de ellas la actriz y escritora Marilu Henner, que hizo p\u00fablica la noticia el pasado 19 de diciembre de 2010 a trav\u00e9s del documental \u201c60 minutos\u201d emitido por la cadena CBS. Las pruebas realizadas a los afectados de hipermnesia demuestran que \u00e9stos son capaces de recordar hasta el detalle m\u00e1s insignificante al ser preguntados por una fecha concreta o al ense\u00f1arles una fotograf\u00eda de cuando eran peque\u00f1os. El hecho de recordar absolutamente todo lo vivido puede llevar a atormentar a estas personas, ya que hasta el m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo detalle de una mala experiencia vivida queda grabado en su prodigiosa memoria. Imaginaos que le se le pregunta por una fecha concreta de hace 25 a\u00f1os, el hipermnesico ser\u00eda capaz de decir c\u00f3mo iba vestido, que desayun\u00f3, que estudi\u00f3 ese d\u00eda en el colegio, los hechos hist\u00f3ricos ocurridos, que programas vio por la televisi\u00f3n o cu\u00e1l era el n\u00ba 1 de los \u00e9xitos musicales, entre otras muchas cosas. Pero el hecho de tener una memoria prodigiosa, donde todo lo que van viviendo se les va almacenando en el disco duro de su cerebro, no es sin\u00f3nimo de que sean m\u00e1s inteligentes que otras personas. La habilidad de recordad todo lo vivido en multitud de ocasiones les aporta serios problemas. Por poner otro ejemplo, si le pedimos que piense en un coche en ese momento por su cabeza pasan im\u00e1genes y datos de todos los coches, modelos, matriculas y colores que ha visto a lo largo de su vida. Lo mismo ocurre si se le habla de flores, \u00e1rboles, televisores, etc\u2026 cualquier cosa que haya tenido alguna relaci\u00f3n en su vida ser\u00e1 recordada con todo lujo de detalles. A penas hay referencias en la historia sobre este s\u00edndrome y las personas que lo han padecido. Uno de los casos m\u00e1s documentados es el de Solomon Shereshevsky, un ciudadano ruso que vivi\u00f3 en la primera mitad del siglo XX y que su hipermnesia lo llev\u00f3 a ejercer de \u201cNmemorista\u201d por locales y tabernas de Mosc\u00fa, en los que realizaba un espect\u00e1culo como si de un ilusionista se tratara. El neuropsic\u00f3logo Alexander Romanovich Luria estudi\u00f3 durante tres d\u00e9cadas el caso de Shereshevsky, dejando importantes escritos sobre el s\u00edndrome. V\u00eddeo de la CBSnews con el documental \u201c60 minutes\u201d en el que se habla de la hipermnesia y del caso de Marilu Henner V\u00eddeo de la ABCnews en el que hace referencia al documental \u201cThe Human Google\u201d Fuentes de consulta y m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n: uci.edu / archive.today.uci.edu / CBSnews / Wikipedia / ABCnews / Quo / CNN Categor\u00edas: Curiosidades Cient\u00edficas Algunos datos curiosos sobre el Empire State Building Escrito por Alfred | 5 Comentarios El 17 de marzo de 1930 comenz\u00f3 la construcci\u00f3n del uno de los edificios m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos del mundo y s\u00edmbolo universal de la ciudad de Nueva York: el Empire State Building. El arquitecto William F. Lamb lo dise\u00f1\u00f3 en unas pocas semanas por encargo del fundador de General Motors, John Jackob Raskob, al querer este \u00faltimo crear un edificio que superase en altura el construido por la competencia (Edificio Chrysler de 318,9 m) inaugurado el 27 de mayo de ese mismo a\u00f1o. Las obras del Empire State Building se realizaron en un tiempo record y en tan solo un a\u00f1o la edificaci\u00f3n estaba terminada y lista para ser inaugurada. El coste total de la construcci\u00f3n fue de 40.948.900 d\u00f3lares (incluida la compra del terreno). M\u00e1s de tres mil obreros trabajaron en la construcci\u00f3n, con un promedio de cuatro pisos y medio alzados por semana. En total se invirtieron 7 millones de horas en mano de obra y 60.000 toneladas de acero para la estructura. Si calcul\u00e1semos su peso total, \u00e9ste podr\u00eda estar sobre las 365.000 toneladas (aproximadamente). La inauguraci\u00f3n oficial se realiz\u00f3 de una manera peculiar el \u00a01 de mayo de 1931, ya que el entonces presidente estadounidense\u00a0 Herbert Hoover le dio a un interruptor desde la Casa Blanca (Washington DC) y las luces del edificio se encendieron. El edificio cuenta con 102 pisos y fue el primero del mundo en tener m\u00e1s de cien plantas. Su altura en 1931 era de 381 metros y en 1953 fue instalada la torre de emisi\u00f3n m\u00e1s la antena de 62 m, lo que le dio la altura (que a\u00fan conserva) de 443.2 metros. Originalmente, la planta 102 como plataforma de aterrizaje de dirigibles.\u00a0 La terraza desde donde se puede observar toda una panor\u00e1mica de la ciudad se encuentra en el piso 86, a 320 metros de altura. Por aquel entonces, el pa\u00eds estaba sumido en plena crisis econ\u00f3mica, lo que hizo que tan s\u00f3lo el 25% de las oficinas fuesen alquiladas, por lo que r\u00e1pidamente se le conoci\u00f3 al edificio como Empty (vac\u00edo) State Building. En 1933 fue utilizado por Merian C. Cooper y Ernest B. Schoedsack en el film King Kong, donde el gorila gigante trepa por \u00e9l. Esta escena se ha convertido en un icono en la historia del cine. Frecuentemente el edificio es utilizado para m\u00faltiples rodajes tanto de publicidad como cinematogr\u00e1ficos. Desde la planta baja hasta el piso 102 hay 1.860 escalones. El mayor desastre ocurrido en el Empire State Building fue el acaecido el s\u00e1bado 28 de julio de 1945, cuando a las 9:40 horas \u00a0un bombardero B25 Mitchell pilotado por el Teniente Coronel William F. Smith Jr se estrell\u00f3 en el lado norte del edificio entre los pisos 79 y 80. La causa del accidente fue la densa niebla con la que hab\u00eda amanecido aquella ma\u00f1ana la ciudad. 14 fueron las v\u00edctimas mortales y los da\u00f1os ocasionados se valoraron en 1 mill\u00f3n de d\u00f3lares. El edificio cuenta con 73 ascensores, de los cuales 6 son montacargas y otros 8 de alta velocidad. Los ascensores tienen una velocidad que oscila entre los 183 y 427 metros por minuto y los m\u00e1s r\u00e1pidos permiten llegar hasta la planta 80 en tan solo 45 segundos. Se calcula que el cableado el\u00e9ctrico del edificio ronda los 7.500 kil\u00f3metros, los cuales suministran alrededor de 40 millones de kilovatios cada hora. Hasta 1972 fue el edificio m\u00e1s alto de Nueva York. Ese a\u00f1o fue inaugurada la torre norte del World Trade Center. Tras el derrumbe de las torres gemelas el 11 de septiembre de 2001, el Empire Estate Bulding\u00a0 volvi\u00f3 a coronar la Gran Manzana. Actualmente est\u00e1 en fase de construcci\u00f3n el One World Trade Center en el solar que qued\u00f3 tras los atentados del 11S. Dicho edificio tendr\u00e1 una altura de 541,33 metros, que lo convertir\u00e1n en el edificio m\u00e1s alto de Estados Unidos y segundo del mundo. Uno de los elementos caracter\u00edsticos del Empire Estate Building son sus focos, que fueron a\u00f1adidos en 1964 para iluminar la parte superior del rascacielos. En fechas se\u00f1aladas o cuando sucede alg\u00fan evento extraordinario, el edificio es iluminado con los colores que se vinculan a dicho acto. El\u00a0 d\u00eda de San Patricio (17 de marzo) el color elegido es el verde. Cuando se estren\u00f3 la pel\u00edcula de Los Simpsons se volvi\u00f3 amarillo. Tambi\u00e9n se utilizan los colores de los equipos deportivos de la ciudad: naranja, azul y blanco para el New York Knicks; rojo, blanco y azul para el New York Rangers y son encendidos de tal modo cada vez que tiene partido. Tras la consecuci\u00f3n del Mundial de Sud\u00e1frica 2010 por parte de la Selecci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola, el Empire State Building se ilumin\u00f3 con los colores de la bandera nacional. Cada a\u00f1o, el 14 de febrero,\u00a0 d\u00eda de San Valent\u00edn, 14 parejas son elegidas para contraer matrimonio en lo m\u00e1s alto de este m\u00edtico edificio neoyorkino.

Pero por muy castizo que el chotis parezca, \u00e9ste tiene una procedencia que no es precisamente de la \u2018Corte y Villa\u2019; ni tan siquiera de nuestro pa\u00eds. La primera vez que se bail\u00f3 un chotis en Espa\u00f1a fue el 3 de noviembre de 1850, en una fiesta organizada por la reina Isabel II en el Palacio Real de Madrid. En dicho evento, los m\u00fasicos tocaron una \u201cPolca alemana\u201d tambi\u00e9n conocida como \u201cSchottisch\u201d que por aquel entonces estaba de moda en gran parte de Centroeuropa. Con los a\u00f1os el baile se populariz\u00f3 en la capital del reino y su nombre fue \u201cespa\u00f1olizado\u201d y pas\u00f3 de llamarse Schottisch a ser conocido como Chotis. Todo parece indicar que el maestro organista de origen italiano, Antonio Apruzzese fue el pionero en tocar el chotis con un organillo, tal y como lo conocemos hoy en d\u00eda. Por su parte, el Schottisch se expandi\u00f3 por diversos pa\u00edses latinoamericanos introducido por los inmigrantes alemanes y/o polacos que hasta all\u00ed viajaron. Imagen tomada de demadridalcielo.org La forma de bailar un Chotis no es complicada. Las parejas que lo ejecutan, ataviadas con los trajes t\u00edpicos de chulapos madrile\u00f1os, lo bailan as\u00ed: El hombre sujeta con una mano a la mujer y con la otra mano, metida en el bolsillo del chaleco y con los dos pies juntos, gira en redondo sobre las punteras de sus zapatos, mientras la mujer baila a su alrededor. Cuando la m\u00fasica lo indica, la pareja da tres pasos hac\u00edas atr\u00e1s y tres hacia adelante y se reinician los giros.

Algunas respuestas a lo sucedido en Jap\u00f3n Escrito por Alfred | 7 Comentarios A estas alturas, por todos son conocidos los acontecimientos ocurridos recientemente en Jap\u00f3n. Pese a que Jap\u00f3n es el pa\u00eds mejor preparado para responder ante un terremoto, el 11 de marzo de 2011 un terremoto de magnitud 8,9 (en la escala Richter) y el posterior tsunami asolaron el noroeste del pa\u00eds. A ra\u00edz de ello, la central nuclear de Fukushima sufri\u00f3 un accidente en los reactores, de consecuencias imprevisibles, por las emisiones radiactivas que pueden originar. Este blog ha querido contribuir a facilitar informaci\u00f3n al respecto y para ello me puse en contacto con, mi buen amigo y Divulgador cient\u00edfico, \u00a0Cayetano Guti\u00e9rrez P\u00e9rez, al que le ped\u00ed su colaboraci\u00f3n explic\u00e1ndonos qu\u00e9 es lo que sucedi\u00f3 en Jap\u00f3n desde la perspectiva cient\u00edfica y con un lenguaje sencillo, para que pueda ser entendido por todos. El siguiente texto es su aportaci\u00f3n, mi m\u00e1s sincero agradecimiento por su desinteresada colaboraci\u00f3n: EL TERREMOTO DE JAP\u00d3N (11-3-11) \u00bfC\u00f3mo se produjo el terremoto? Jap\u00f3n tiene una larga historia de terremotos, ya que se encuentra en una situaci\u00f3n geol\u00f3gica muy propensa a sufrir movimientos s\u00edsmicos, de forma peri\u00f3dica, justamente en la convergencia de cuatro placas tect\u00f3nicas. El responsable del terremoto ha sido el choque entre las placas tect\u00f3nicas, que produce una fricci\u00f3n entre bloques de terreno y unas deformaciones que provocan que el suelo se rompa y se libere una gran energ\u00eda s\u00edsmica. El terremoto con epicentro en el Oc\u00e9ano Pac\u00edfico, a 130 km de la costa y a una profundidad de 20 km, fue de tal intensidad que modific\u00f3 ligeramente el eje de rotaci\u00f3n terrestre en unos 10 cm, lo que provocar\u00e1 un acortamiento del d\u00eda, aunque en una magnitud que es apreciable \u00fanicamente mediante relojes at\u00f3micos (2 millon\u00e9simas de segundo). Asimismo, desplaz\u00f3 al archipi\u00e9lago nip\u00f3n 2,4 m. Tras el terremoto, en d\u00edas sucesivos, hubo m\u00e1s de 200 r\u00e9plicas \u00bfC\u00f3mo se produjo el tsunami? El tsunami se produjo porque el terremoto origin\u00f3 unas olas sobre el mar, que se desplazaron en todas las direcciones hacia las costas, al igual que cuando tiramos una piedra en un lago. El tsunami alcanz\u00f3 10 m de altura, se desplaz\u00f3 a 500 km/h, y penetr\u00f3 hasta 15 km tierra adentro. \u00bfC\u00f3mo se produce el accidente nuclear de Fukushima? El accidente nuclear de Jap\u00f3n (el tercer accidente nuclear m\u00e1s grave tras el de Three Mile Island-1979 y Chernobil-1986) fue consecuencia del terremoto y pone de manifiesto que la energ\u00eda nuclear resulta incontrolable ante los desastres de la naturaleza. La central nuclear japonesa de Fukushima, ubicada a 250 km de Tokio, es considerada como una central muy segura. Pero la fuerza del terremoto fue 30 veces superior a la que pod\u00eda soportar la central nuclear de Fukushima, inutilizando los sistemas de refrigeraci\u00f3n de cuatro de los seis reactores nucleares y provocando explosiones en tres de ellos, lo que elev\u00f3 peligrosamente el nivel de radiactividad en el aire. Para disminuir la temperatura de los reactores nucleares se abrieron de forma controlada las v\u00e1lvulas de los reactores, liberando al medio ambiente vapor con sustancias radiactivas, que ha provocado la contaminaci\u00f3n radiactiva de varias decenas de personas. Por ese motivo, se han evacuado cerca de 200.000 personas que resid\u00edan en las proximidades de la central nuclear y han trazado un per\u00edmetro de alerta de 30 km. \u00bfQu\u00e9 consecuencias tendr\u00e1n las emisiones radiactivas del accidente nuclear de Fukushima? En principio, s\u00f3lo los trabajadores que operan dentro de la central nuclear se exponen a riesgos para su salud, que aunque no son letales, elevan el riesgo de desarrollar un c\u00e1ncer. Pero en el accidente, se han alcanzado picos radiactivos de 400 milisieverts (mSv, unidad de medici\u00f3n de la radiaci\u00f3n). Los expertos consideran que una dosis de 5.000 mSv es letal en un plazo de pocas semanas para m\u00e1s del 50% de los afectados. Sin embargo, 100 mSv al a\u00f1o ya son suficientes para elevar las posibilidades de desarrollar un c\u00e1ncer a largo plazo. Por t\u00e9rmino medio, estamos expuestos a una radiaci\u00f3n de unos 2 mSv al a\u00f1o. Las principales consecuencias de la radiactividad en la salud de las personas son las siguientes: S\u00edndrome de radiaci\u00f3n aguda: Sucede con un alto nivel de exposici\u00f3n en un periodo corto de tiempo. Una radiaci\u00f3n de 1.000 mSv en una dosis produce efectos inmediatos (reducci\u00f3n de leucocitos, fiebre o n\u00e1useas\u2026). Con dosis superiores, pueden producirse lesiones cut\u00e1neas, p\u00e9rdida de pelo, y alta probabilidad de desarrollar c\u00e1ncer a medio y largo plazo. Niveles de 3.500 mSv ya pueden ser letales en cuesti\u00f3n de semanas si no son tratados debidamente. C\u00e1ncer: Los individuos expuestos a una radiaci\u00f3n superior a 100 mSv al a\u00f1o ven incrementadas las posibilidades de sufrir c\u00e1ncer a medio y largo plazo. El tumor de tiroides y la leucemia son los m\u00e1s frecuentes. Mutaciones gen\u00e9ticas, esterilidad, y cataratas. \u00a0 \u00bfCu\u00e1les son las mentiras sobre la energ\u00eda nuclear? Los lobbys que defienden la energ\u00eda nuclear utilizan con frecuencia falacias para dividir y confundir a la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica. 1\u00aa FALACIA: Se dice que la electricidad de origen nuclear es la m\u00e1s barata Es una verdad a medias, ya que en realidad no se tienen en cuenta los gastos de la gesti\u00f3n de los residuos, especialmente los de alta intensidad, que poseen una duraci\u00f3n de m\u00e1s de 100.000 a\u00f1os, por lo que realmente no es tan barata. Por otra parte, en el precio de la energ\u00eda nuclear tampoco se incluyen los da\u00f1os potenciales a terceros que un accidente nuclear podr\u00eda provocar a cientos de miles de personas e incluso a sus descendientes (caso de Chern\u00f3bil o el caso de Fukushima). Adem\u00e1s, no perdamos de vista que si el terrorismo internacional ha sido capaz de cometer el tr\u00e1gico atentado contra EE.UU., el 11-9-2001, \u00bfalguien puede asegurar que no pueden atentar contra una central nuclear?, cuyas consecuencias ser\u00edan imprevisibles, ya que la nube radiactiva formada posee un efecto transfronteras (al igual que la contaminaci\u00f3n) y puede incluso descargar agua radiactiva hasta en el propio pa\u00eds de procedencia de los terroristas. Y es que la sinraz\u00f3n del fundamentalismo terrorista y sus actuaciones son totalmente imprevisibles al igual que los fen\u00f3menos de la naturaleza, como el terremoto de Jap\u00f3n. 2\u00aa FALACIA: Se afirma que Espa\u00f1a tiene que importar electricidad de origen nuclear de Francia porque no produce suficiente energ\u00eda Es completamente falsa, ya que seg\u00fan Red El\u00e9ctrica Espa\u00f1ola, desde 2004, Espa\u00f1a es un pa\u00eds exportador de electricidad, por eso, en 2008 se export\u00f3 un 3,8% de la energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica producida a Portugal, Marruecos y Andorra e importamos un 1% de Francia. En 2009, seg\u00fan Adena, se export\u00f3 el 8% de la electricidad producida. Conclusi\u00f3n final sobre el uso de la energ\u00eda nuclear Como reflexi\u00f3n final, recordemos que los combustibles f\u00f3siles y la energ\u00eda nuclear han sido energ\u00edas de \u00e9lite durante los siglos XIX y XX, y como s\u00f3lo se encuentran en algunos pa\u00edses, han requerido enormes inversiones militares para garantizar su seguridad y unos desembolsos de capital elevados para procesarlos y comercializarlos (que no se incluyen en le precio final del kW.h). El resultado ha sido un desequilibrio cada vez mayor entre quienes poseen energ\u00eda y los que carecen de ella. Sin embargo, hay energ\u00edas renovables por toda la Tierra, de f\u00e1cil acceso: energ\u00eda solar, e\u00f3lica, hidr\u00e1ulica, geot\u00e9rmica, biomasa\u2026 Por tanto, como hemos visto en el caso de Jap\u00f3n, los fen\u00f3menos de la Naturaleza son imprevisibles y pueden dar lugar a cat\u00e1strofes en centrales nucleares de consecuencias grav\u00edsimas para la humanidad, por lo que debemos ser conscientes que ante la energ\u00eda nuclear no existe la seguridad al 100%, mientras que otras fuentes energ\u00e9ticas, especialmente las renovables, tendr\u00edan unas consecuencias mucho menos graves en caso de accidente.

Escrito por Alfred | 1 Comentario Hoy en d\u00eda, cualquier producto que se pone a la venta est\u00e1 legislado bajo unas normas y/o leyes, normalmente internacionales. Esto mismo es lo que ocurre con los cosm\u00e9ticos y productos de belleza e higiene personal. Cualquiera de estos productos debe se incorporar en su etiqueta todos los ingredientes que lo componen y se hace en base a una nomenclatura universal llamada INCI (International Nomenclature Cosmetic Ingredient) y que se aplica en la mayor\u00eda de los pa\u00edses del planeta acogidos a esta norma. En Europa, la normativa para la regulaci\u00f3n de los productos cosm\u00e9ticos se aprob\u00f3 en 1976 por la CEE y la nomenclatura INCI se puso en marcha en la Uni\u00f3n Europea a partir de 1998, regulada y controlada por la Colipa, (The European cosmetic association). En EEUU se aplica la misma nomenclatura desde mediados de los a\u00f1os 80 y \u00e9sta est\u00e1 regulada por la CTFA (Cosmetic Toiletry, and Fragrance Association).

Escrito por Alfred | 9 Comentarios A consecuencia del terrible terremoto de 8,9 grados y posterior Tsunami que ha sacudido Jap\u00f3n, he recibido una docena de correos y mensajes de lectores que me preguntaban sobre \u201c\u00bfC\u00f3mo se produce un tsunami?\u201d. Buscando info para publicar un post he recordado que, hace poco m\u00e1s de un a\u00f1o, el compa\u00f1ero blogger y amigo Alberto Araque public\u00f3 una estupenda entrada en su blog \u201cMezclado, no agitado\u201d, bajo el t\u00edtulo \u201c\u00bfC\u00f3mo se produce un tsunami?\u201d, en el que lo explicaba de manera gr\u00e1fica, sencilla y clara: En realidad, el tsunami es la causa de un terremoto que se origina en el fondo del mar. El movimiento de la tierra hace que se produzca un desplazamiento del lecho marino y del agua que tiene encima. De esta manera, el agua del oc\u00e9ano, al tratar de recuperar su estado habitual, genera olas de grandes dimensiones que se desplazan a gran velocidad. Para entenderlo mejor, imagina que en un lago, por ejemplo, tiras una piedra m\u00e1s o menos grande, esto provoca una ondas en todas direcciones que salen conc\u00e9ntricamente del lugar donde tiraste la piedra. Cuanto mayor sea la piedra/terremoto, mayores ser\u00e1n las ondas/olas producidas y llegar\u00e1n con m\u00e1s velocidad a la costa.

That is absolutely incredible. Both the fact that he followed through, that you ordered, and that they overnighted it on THEIR dime, is pretty stinking impressive. If Nordstrom does find out, it'll be interesting to see how they handle that, if/how the implement it company-wide, and what recognition Dave will get. Keep us posted if your hear anything else ;)So lets see. Nordstrom's Dave is living the title of your blog Edward! I don't think I will ever want to give up the shopping/discovery aspect of being in a store. And I doubt a store wants to dissuade me from coming in. BUT you have heard me hammer the ROI because of my sales/finance background. This is mega huge ROI. Imagine the dead time in the store. Espcially one like Nordstroms where customers tend to be upper income people. You have your workers act as personal shoppers for people they know want something and can afford to pay for it. So they technically are bringing people in/selling when it is the dead time in the store! Nordstrom should not look at this as a paying so you can have a free personal shopper. They have to pay for the time they are on clock. Why not reaching outside the store to sell? I will thank luckthelady for covering this in adverve Awesome!I love Nordstom... simply put, they have always impressed me with their customer service, even during the busiest times of the year. They are extremely helpful, as as your post shows... they know how to connect and make life easier for their customers. Thanks!Years ago if you had a small boutique or store OR if you were a commissioned sales person at a high end store like Bullock's Wilshire, Bergdorf Goodman you would keep track of the lines and products that your customers preferred and either call them or send them a handwritten note that something had come in which you thought would interest them. This kind of personalized service still existed when I first moved to NYC - in 1989 getting a handwritten note from the salesperson at Crate and Barrel who had helped me buy dining room furniture. The same for a Chanel make up salesperson at Henri Bendel. I don't see any difference except new tools. I imagine when the access is as quick as a digital tool there is the chance that it could get out of hand, but because most sales people don't think like the ad/marketing division of their store it's unlikely that nordstromdave will end up over using the access he has gained with Edward. Only time will tell and as you suggest Edward,we might have some say in that. Give the salesperson some credit that if they overdo and loose your business they will think twice about why, tweet you and you have the opportunity to enlighten them. I really like hearing that there is some personalization going on with digital tools in this way. Most of us hate going shopping because it feels so impersonal, like flying on an airplane now. Great to think that there is someone out there who wants to make a sale with someone he has identified as a sure-thing customer, you to have one of those great looking shirts within 24 hours and nordstromdave gets the sale. I would be curious to know if he works on commission or if there is any sales incentives for sales people at Nordstrom. Since they have always maintained a \"service excellence\" profile it doesn't surprise me that it was a Nordstrom's store where you are having this experience. Can you ask him if it was his idea or a sales idea from within? More research could be interesting.MelindaWax You are dead on that these are just tools. But they make personal service even easier and less effort than that personal note. And for me, much better. I would rather the DM than a note. It's easier to store, keep track of and respond to. I know for a fact that the initiative is from Dave and not Nordstrom. Smart on his part. We actually had a conversation about how he should take his idea and attempt to institutionalize it -- teach others to use it and get the corporation interested. However, in an ideal world, a sales person would customize his use of tools to what a customer wanted. Some people might prefer email, texting or even Instagram.Jeremy, I envy you. Yesterday, I actually had to go to the Nordstrom store and buy three shirts, two of which were not in stock in my size and are now being shipped to my house free of charge. Unfortunately, my sales guy is not @NordstromDave. My sales guy was John. No mention of apps or twitpics. I am wondering if @NordstromDave is making his endeavor solo, or if it is a program that Nordstrom half-implemented and that never got to John's store.I am disappointed that I did not have a similar customer experience that could have saved me time in the future. That said, I will continue to shop at Nordstrom as I am loyal to their products and service.This is awesome. But only until the retailer unavoidably crosses the thin line that separates \"marketing as service\" from \"marketing as hassle\". There will come a day when -- despite his best efforts -- you will hate @NordstromDave the way you might hate being trapped in an elevator with a drunk who is just learning to play the bagpipes. Also, with respect, I must disagree with David Ginsburg about this returning \"big dividends\". When we multiply customers receiving DMs and subtract staff cost from the ROI equation we will need an electron microscope to spot the dividend. In short, it's hard to see where this sort of system (in its current, hey-let's-try-something form) turns into something that's good for the retailer and the customer. When you scale 1-to-1 into something profitable, it becomes stalking.tomcunniff@nordstromdave I'm not sure that I agree. Or at least not in totality. Granted, in the hands of ad minded marketers who like to push (you should my email stream) this is a total annoyance. But Dave responded only as he said he would: sharing images of what I wanted him to share, in a timely manner, as a good account manager might do for any client. Social media and Twitter are only tools. But in the right hands, done the right way (based on a customer's preferences) they're incredibly valuable and far more efficient than direct mail, email, phone service, etc. Any good sales person in a high end (or just specialty -- wine, bicycle, etc) store might have 100--500 regular clients. Should be easy to service them this way.edwardboches tomcunniff@nordstromdave Completely agree that these are just tools, and as such are only as good as the people who use them. Unfortunately, marketers have a distressing habit of taking things that work, then pushing them until they begin to operate in reverse. tomcunniffWell then, it's our job to prevent that. Join me.edwardboches I do the best I can, as I'm sure you do. But to borrow a phrase from Albert Einstein, \"Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former\" :-)Love this! What a great case study for the real-world implications of small tactics returning big dividends. Hope Nordstrom's encourages more staff to do the same, under a set of loose guidelines as suggested in the post. Nice shirt, btw."}

Using IAW to write an article is so incredibly fast and easy that you\u2019ll never dread having to learn how to write an article ever again. How to Write an Article with IAW The first thing you do when you need to write an article is just to search for content that is relevant to your keyword. As you can see in the screenshot below, a search for colon cancer returned a large volume of results. Armed with your results, you can now drastically shorten the time it takes you to write an article.

Once you have added enough sentences to reach the number of words that you needed to write an article, you\u2019ll be looking at a screenshot like the one below. Notice over on the right side of the screen. That is all the content that you sourced from the search results. Remember, all you needed to do was to click on sentences to add them to the article. You haven\u2019t even typed yet!! Once you have your article, its time to replace\u00a0synonyms\u00a0so that you will end up with an article that is unique and will pass copyscape. If you have used The Best Spinner before, you\u2019ll understand how this works. If you haven\u2019t, I\u2019ve blogged about it previously. As you can see in the screenshot below, replace synonyms is also incredibly easy because the software automatically suggest which words to replace, and then offers up several suggestions for words that you can use in place of the original words. Watch a video that demonstrates exactly how to write an article using IAW So there you have it; a quick overview of how to write an article in just a few minutes using IAW.

March 17th, 2011 | Category: Uncategorized | Leave a comment Understanding Kokoro Greets faithful fans of Joe, Long ago, when I first asked Joe to teach me some Japanese words, so I too could skeeve on the girls he was chasing, he gave me one of his \u2018Joe-looks\u2019 and promptly started smashing my hands with his fists. He screamed out \u201cHidari!\u201d then brought his fist hard down on my right hand, then followed closely with a shrill \u201cMigi!\u201d as he slapped the living shit out of my left. The puzzled expression on my face was soon mimicked on his. \u201cWaitaminute!\u201d, he exclaimed. \u201cThat was backward.\u201d \u201cJoe, I don\u2019t-\u201d My left hand was quickly slapped, pimp-style. \u201cHidari!\u201d, he screamed at me. And thus my lessons in Japanese began. Continuing from his first unique language seminar of slapping me, most of Joe\u2019s lessons involved him expounding on the attitude of speaking the Japanese language. He would ramble on about how all gaijin are taught a far too feminine manner of speaking. Joe looked me in the eye and said, \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna let that happen to you. You\u2019re gonna learn my method.\u201d The methodology he would develop shoulda been called simply: How to be a Badass in Japanese. Joe mentioned recently on my last trip to Japan that he is filled with regret over teaching me in this manner. I\u2019ve probably done nothing but embarrass him with my finely trained Japanese gutter-mouth in too many formal business meetings now. Still, it\u2019s his own damn fault. I will give him credit though. Often Joe would have moments of real insight. Especially when we were eating food. Joe could teach you one hell of a lesson over a meal. Something about it would always click. With this in mind, I kept the portable recorder burning one night in Ginza as we dined on Oden. Out of that recording, we got this little gem animated. \u201cKokoro\u201d is perhaps the most important Japanese word I\u2019ve ever learned. To know one single word that surmises the entire philosophy of how my animation studio is run is a powerful thing. When you watch this mini episode, you will (probably) learn the true meaning of the word. I encourage each of you to run your life with Kokoro burning hot in your heart. With Heart, -Island Masta PS : Here are some fun link things from Genki Japan that while probably not as effective as Joe slapping you on the inverse hand and screaming \u201cMigi! Hidari!\u201d, might still be instructional.

Exciting! If you\u2019re a nerd. November 12th, 2009 | Category: Graphic Novel, Production | Leave a comment why we chose green... It was an agonizing decisions to go with a green base color for the JiJ site. Really, who the hell has a green website these days? Maybe it would make perfect sense if the show & comic were called Joe is The Father of Christmas? It\u2019s not as if there any special color scheme for Japan that is dependent on green\u2026 Well anywho, here is the site, and it IS green. Hope you can still enjoy the ride. \u00a0 Oh yeah, so the site\u2019s not just some stupid placeholder thing anymore. It\u2019s on it\u2019s way to becoming the real deal. We hope to have updates on a more frequent basis. Espically now that we are close to finishing the 360 page frist volume of the graphic novel. Yep\u2026 you read that right. Three-Hundred-and-Sixy pages\u2026 and yes, that\u2019s only Volume One. That\u2019s right. This just got real.

Tweet Lun, 28/03/2011 - 18:37 Foto: EFE Contenido relacionadoNotas Reconocen a Patarroyo por su labor en la b\u00fasqueda de vacunas sint\u00e9ticas Bogot\u00e1.- El cient\u00edfico colombiano y descubridor de la primera vacuna contra la malaria, Manuel Elkin Patarroyo, hall\u00f3 los principios qu\u00edmicos que permitir\u00e1n crear vacunas sint\u00e9ticas para prevenir pr\u00e1cticamente todas la enfermedades infecciosas existentes en el mundo. Tras m\u00e1s de 30 a\u00f1os de investigaciones, Patarroyo inform\u00f3 de su hallazgo en una entrevista con Efe despu\u00e9s de que fuera publicado hoy por la revista estadounidense Chemical Reviews, lo que le dio el aval del mundo cient\u00edfico. Se trata de \"un dec\u00e1logo de principios, de reglas, que cuando se aplican permiten producir vacunas contra las distintas enfermedades que existen en el mundo, podremos as\u00ed cubrir pr\u00e1cticamente las 517 enfermedades infecciosas\", afirm\u00f3. El cient\u00edfico hall\u00f3 estos principios, que evitar\u00edan a futuro millones de muertes en el planeta, a partir del descubrimiento de su primera vacuna contra la malaria, en 1986, y desarrollar despu\u00e9s el f\u00e1rmaco de segunda generaci\u00f3n con cobertura superior al 90 por ciento en ensayos con monos. De esas 517 enfermedades, s\u00f3lo quince tienen vacuna, motivo por el que Patarroyo y su equipo de la Fundaci\u00f3n Instituto de Inmunolog\u00eda de Colombia (FIIC) afrontaron \"el problema desde el punto de vista de la qu\u00edmica\", un hito en la ciencia ya que las \u00fanicas existentes se desarrollaron a partir de la biolog\u00eda. Una vez introducido el microbio en el organismo a trav\u00e9s de la picadura del mosquito y alcanzado el h\u00edgado, \"reconocimos las prote\u00ednas o mol\u00e9culas que el par\u00e1sito utiliza para pegarse a las c\u00e9lulas que va a infectar y luego averiguamos su estructura qu\u00edmica tras hacerlas fragmentos\", relat\u00f3 el reconocido doctor. \"Eso, per s\u00e9, es un gran descubrimiento, pero esos fragmentos no se pueden utilizar como vacunas porque el sistema de defensas es ciego, no los ve\", agreg\u00f3, al explicar que esa ceguera del sistema inmunol\u00f3gico es la que permite a los microbios esconderse en el organismo. La soluci\u00f3n fue modificar los fragmentos a trav\u00e9s de la qu\u00edmica, es decir, crear prote\u00ednas sint\u00e9ticas e id\u00e9nticas a las de las \u00fanicas partes del microbio capaces de adherirse a los gl\u00f3bulos rojos para despu\u00e9s cambiar el orden de los componentes. Esta f\u00f3rmula deja visibles las mol\u00e9culas antes irreconocibles por el sistema inmunol\u00f3gico. El cient\u00edfico lo explica con palabras sencillas: \"darle la vuelta a los deditos de las manitas del microbio\" para hacerlos visibles, en alusi\u00f3n a las \u00fanicas partes que se pegan a las c\u00e9lulas porque el resto del par\u00e1sito no contagia y por tanto no sirve para la elaboraci\u00f3n de la vacuna, al no garantizar la prevenci\u00f3n de la enfermedad al cien por cien. \"As\u00ed la mol\u00e9cula (copiada qu\u00edmicamente y despu\u00e9s modificada) se vuelve altamente productora de anticuerpos, de defensas, y puede ser utilizada como vacuna\", matiz\u00f3. Si bien estas conclusiones parten del estudio de la malaria, Patarroyo ha demostrado que esos principios sirven para contrarrestar el resto de males infecciosos. El colombiano trabaja fundamentalmente con el microbio de la malaria porque, entre otros motivos, es uno de los m\u00e1s destructores por la rapidez con la que se propaga al interior del organismo: \"hay cerca de 500 millones de casos al a\u00f1o y de esos casi tres mueren, la mayor\u00eda ni\u00f1os menores de cinco a\u00f1os en \u00c1frica\". Tras el \u00faltimo descubrimiento, se podr\u00e1 aplicar a la tuberculosis, papiloma humano, dengue, hepatitis C o lepra, s\u00f3lo por citar algunas de las enfermedades m\u00e1s comunes de entre el medio millar de infecciosas, \"que en total provocan anualmente la muerte a 16 millones de personas\", indic\u00f3 el cient\u00edfico. Patarroyo descubri\u00f3 la primera vacuna contra la malaria en 1986, denominada SPF-66, y tras realizar ensayos en m\u00e1s de 50.000 individuos de distintos pa\u00edses se verific\u00f3 su efectividad entre un 30 y 50 por ciento. En 1996, cuando cedi\u00f3 la patente a la Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud (OMS), dej\u00f3 de aplicarla para sumergirse en la investigaci\u00f3n y buscar su efectividad al cien por cien. Ahora, 25 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, ya tiene la segunda generaci\u00f3n de esta vacuna, a la que denomina COLFAVAC y de la que ha comprobado una efectividad superior al 90 por ciento en monos. \"Vamos a comenzar los ensayos en humanos y estamos absolutamente seguros de que tendremos los mismos resultados\", adelant\u00f3, al constatar, tambi\u00e9n tras a\u00f1os de investigaciones, que el organismo de los micos amaz\u00f3nicos que usa son id\u00e9nticos al del hombre. El colombiano ha recibido numerosos galardones a lo largo de su carrera, como el Pr\u00edncipe de Asturias, Robert Koch Medaille, Premio Internacional Latinoamericano en Neumolog\u00eda Fernando D. G\u00f3mez, Le\u00f3n Bernard de la OMS y Pr\u00edncipe de Viana de la Solidaridad. Patarroyo financia sus investigaciones con fondos del Gobierno espa\u00f1ol y la Caja de Ahorros de Navarra, as\u00ed como de la Universidad colombiana del Rosario. EFE View the forum thread.

All you have to do is paste the code below into your functions.php file: function share_this($content){ if(!is_feed() && !is_home()) { $content .= '<div class=\"share-this\"> <a href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\">Tweet</a> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script> <div class=\"facebook-share-button\"> <iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href='. urlencode(get_permalink($post->ID)) .'&amp;layout=button_count&amp;show_faces=false&amp;width=200&amp;action=like&amp;colorscheme=light&amp;height=21\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:200px; height:21px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </div> </div>'; } return $content; } add_action('the_content', 'share_this'); Source \u2192Track Post View Amount by Using Post MetaFor a simple way to keep track of the number of post views, paste this snippet into the functions.php, and then follow steps 1 and 2. function getPostViews($postID){ $count_key = 'post_views_count'; $count = get_post_meta($postID, $count_key, true); if($count==''){ delete_post_meta($postID, $count_key); add_post_meta($postID, $count_key, '0'); return \"0 View\"; } return $count.' Views'; } function setPostViews($postID) { $count_key = 'post_views_count'; $count = get_post_meta($postID, $count_key, true); if($count==''){ $count = 0; delete_post_meta($postID, $count_key); add_post_meta($postID, $count_key, '0'); }else{ $count++; update_post_meta($postID, $count_key, $count); } } Step 1: Paste the code below within the single.php within the loop: <?php setPostViews(get_the_ID()); ?> Step 2: Paste the snippet below anywhere within the template where you would like to display the number of views: <?php echo getPostViews(get_the_ID()); ?> Source \u2192Track Post View Amount by Using Post MetaThis snippet will create a list of your most popular posts based on page views. Please note that this will only work if you have already implemented the \u2018Track Post View Amount by Using Post Meta\u2019 from above. Place this snippet just before the loop within the index.php template and WordPress will use the post views to order your posts from highest to lowest. <? query_posts('meta_key=post_views_count&orderby=post_views_count&order=DESC'); ?> Source \u2192Breadcrumbs Without a PluginBreadcrumbs can be a useful navigation technique that offers link to the previous page the user navigated through to arrive at the current post/page. There are plugins you could use, but the code snippet below could be an easier solution.Paste this code into your functions.php file. function the_breadcrumb() { echo '<ul id=\"crumbs\">'; if (!is_home()) { echo '<li><a href=\"'; echo get_option('home'); echo '\">'; echo 'Home'; echo \"</a></li>\"; if (is_category() || is_single()) { echo '<li>'; the_category(' </li><li> '); if (is_single()) { echo \"</li><li>\"; the_title(); echo '</li>'; } } elseif (is_page()) { echo '<li>'; echo the_title(); echo '</li>'; } } elseif (is_tag()) {single_tag_title();} elseif (is_day()) {echo\"<li>Archive for \"; the_time('F jS, Y'); echo'</li>';} elseif (is_month()) {echo\"<li>Archive for \"; the_time('F, Y'); echo'</li>';} elseif (is_year()) {echo\"<li>Archive for \"; the_time('Y'); echo'</li>';} elseif (is_author()) {echo\"<li>Author Archive\"; echo'</li>';} elseif (isset($_GET['paged']) && !empty($_GET['paged'])) {echo \"<li>Blog Archives\"; echo'</li>';} elseif (is_search()) {echo\"<li>Search Results\"; echo'</li>';} echo '</ul>'; }Then paste the calling code below, wherever you would like the breadcrumbs to appear (typically above the title tag).<?php the_breadcrumb(); ?>Source \u2192Display the Number of Facebook FansFacebook is a must site for sharing your blogs articles. Here is a method for showing your visitors the total number of Facebook \u2018Likes\u2019 your blog currently has.To use this code all you have to do is replace the YOUR PAGE-ID with your own Facebook page id.<?php $page_id = \"YOUR PAGE-ID\"; $xml = @simplexml_load_file(\"http://api.facebook.com/restserver.php?method=facebook.fql.query&query=SELECT%20fan_count%20FROM%20page%20WHERE%20page_id=\".$page_id.\"\") or die (\"a lot\"); $fans = $xml->page->fan_count; echo $fans; ?>Source \u2192Display an External RSS FeedThis snippet will fetch the latest entries of any specified feed url.<?php include_once(ABSPATH.WPINC.'/rss.php'); wp_rss('http://wpforums.com/external.php?type=RSS2', 5); ?>This code takes the rss.php file that is built into WordPress (used for widgets). It is set to display the most recent 5 posts from the RSS feed \u2018http://example.com/external.php?type=RSS2\u2032.Source \u2192WP Shortcode to Display External FilesIf you are looking for a quick way to automatically include external page content within your post, this snippet will create a shortcode allowing you to do it.Paste this code into your themes functions.php file: function show_file_func( $atts ) { extract( shortcode_atts( array( 'file' => '' ), $atts ) ); if ($file!='') return @file_get_contents($file); } add_shortcode( 'show_file', 'show_file_func' ); And then post this shortcode, editing the URL, into your post or page. [show_file file=\"http://speckyboy.com/2010/12/09/20-plugin-replacing-tutorials-tips-snippets-and-solutions-for-wordpress/\"] Source \u2192Create Custom Widgets Wordpress provides many widgets, but if you want to create custom widgets tailored to your blog, then this snippet may help you.Paste the code below into your functions.php file. class My_Widget extends WP_Widget { function My_Widget() { parent::WP_Widget(false, 'Our Test Widget'); } function form($instance) { // outputs the options form on admin } function update($new_instance, $old_instance) { // processes widget options to be saved return $new_instance; } function widget($args, $instance) { // outputs the content of the widget } } register_widget('My_Widget'); Source \u2192Create Custom ShortcodesShortcodes are a handy way of using code functions within your theme. The advantage of shortcodes is that they can be easily used with the WordPress post editor.Add this code to your functions.php:function helloworld() { return 'Hello World!'; } add_shortcode('hello', 'helloworld');You can then use [hello] wherever you want to display the content of the shortcode.Source \u2192Custom Title LengthThis snippet will allow you to customise the length (by the number of characters) of your post title.Paste this code into the functions.php: function ODD_title($char) { $title = get_the_title($post->ID); $title = substr($title,0,$char); echo $title; }To use this function all you have to do is paste the below code into your theme files, remembering to change the \u201920\u2032 to what ever character amount you require: <?php ODD_title(20); ?> Source \u2192Custom ExcerptsSometimes you may need to limit how many words are in the excerpt, with this snippet you can create your own custom excerpt (my_excerpts) replacing the original.Paste this code in functions.php. <?php add_filter('the_excerpt', 'my_excerpts'); function my_excerpts($content = false) { global $post; $mycontent = $post->post_excerpt; $mycontent = $post->post_content; $mycontent = strip_shortcodes($mycontent); $mycontent = str_replace(']]>', ']]&gt;', $mycontent); $mycontent = strip_tags($mycontent); $excerpt_length = 55; $words = explode(' ', $mycontent, $excerpt_length + 1); if(count($words) > $excerpt_length) : array_pop($words); array_push($words, '...'); $mycontent = implode(' ', $words); endif; $mycontent = '<p>' . $mycontent . '</p>'; // Make sure to return the content return $mycontent; } ?>Secondly, paste this code within the Loop: <?php echo my_excerpts(); ?> Source \u2192Redirect Your Post Titles To External Links This snippet could be useful for anyone with a news submission site, by redirecting your post title to an external URL when clicked via a custom field.Paste this snippet into your functions.php file://Custom Redirection function print_post_title() { global $post; $thePostID = $post->ID; $post_id = get_post($thePostID); $title = $post_id->post_title; $perm = get_permalink($post_id); $post_keys = array(); $post_val = array(); $post_keys = get_post_custom_keys($thePostID); if (!empty($post_keys)) { foreach ($post_keys as $pkey) { if ($pkey=='url') { $post_val = get_post_custom_values($pkey); } } if (empty($post_val)) { $link = $perm; } else { $link = $post_val[0]; } } else { $link = $perm; } echo '<h2><a href=\"'.$link.'\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"'.$title.'\">'.$title.'</a></h2>'; }Then you add a custom field named \u2018url\u2019 and in the value field put the link to which the title is to be redirected to.Source \u2192Redirect to Single Post If There is One Post in Category/TagIf there is only one post within a category or tag, this little snippet will jump the reader directly to the post page.Paste this code into your themes functions.php file: function stf_redirect_to_post(){ global $wp_query; // If there is one post on archive page if( is_archive() && $wp_query->post_count == 1 ){ // Setup post data the_post(); // Get permalink $post_url = get_permalink(); // Redirect to post page wp_redirect( $post_url ); } } add_action('template_redirect', 'stf_redirect_to_post'); Source \u2192List Scheduled/Future PostsPaste the code anywhere on your template where you want your scheduled posts to be listed, changing the max number or displayed posts by changing the value of showposts in the query. <?php $my_query = new WP_Query('post_status=future&order=DESC&showposts=5'); if ($my_query->have_posts()) { while ($my_query->have_posts()) : $my_query->the_post(); $do_not_duplicate = $post->ID; ?> <li><?php the_title(); ?></li> <?php endwhile; } ?> Source \u2192Screenshots of External Pages Without a PluginThis is a very simple URL script that will generate a screenshot of any website. Here is the URL:http://s.wordpress.com/mshots/v1/http%3A%2F%2Fspeckyboy.com%2F?w=500To see what the link above does, click here.All you have to do is insert your required URL in the place of the \u2018speckyboy.com\u2019 part of the link and resize (\u2018w=500\u2032) as required.Add Content to the End of Each RSS PostAdding some extra content that is only viewable by your RSS subscribers couldn\u2019t be easier with this snippet. Paste this code into the functions.php: function feedFilter($query) { if ($query->is_feed) { add_filter('the_content','feedContentFilter'); } return $query; } add_filter('pre_get_posts','feedFilter'); function feedContentFilter($content) { $content .= '<p>Extra RSS content goes here... </p>'; return $content; } Source \u2192Reset Your WordPress PasswordWhat would you do if you forget your WordPress Admin Password and you no longer have access to the admin area? To fix this all you have to do is jump to your PhpMyAdmin Sql-window and run the following command.UPDATE `wp_users` SET `user_pass` = MD5('NEW_PASSWORD') WHERE `wp_users`.`user_login` =`YOUR_USER_NAME` LIMIT 1;Source \u2192Detect Which Browser Your Visitors are UsingIf you want to use different stylesheets for different browsers, then this is a snippet you could use. It detects the browser your visitors are using and creates a different class for each browser. You can use that class to create custom stylesheets.add_filter('body_class','browser_body_class'); function browser_body_class($classes) { global $is_lynx, $is_gecko, $is_IE, $is_opera, $is_NS4, $is_safari, $is_chrome, $is_iphone; if($is_lynx) $classes[] = 'lynx'; elseif($is_gecko) $classes[] = 'gecko'; elseif($is_opera) $classes[] = 'opera'; elseif($is_NS4) $classes[] = 'ns4'; elseif($is_safari) $classes[] = 'safari'; elseif($is_chrome) $classes[] = 'chrome'; elseif($is_IE) $classes[] = 'ie'; else $classes[] = 'unknown'; if($is_iphone) $classes[] = 'iphone'; return $classes; }Source \u2192Display Search Terms from Google UsersIf a visitor reached your site through Google\u2019s search, this script will display the terms they searched for in order to find your site. Just paste it anywhere outside of the header section. <?php $refer = $_SERVER[\"HTTP_REFERER\"]; if (strpos($refer, \"google\")) { $refer_string = parse_url($refer, PHP_URL_QUERY); parse_str($refer_string, $vars); $search_terms = $vars['q']; echo 'Welcome Google visitor! You searched for the following terms to get here: '; echo $search_terms; }; ?> Source \u2192Show Different Content for Mac & WindowsIf you ever have the need to display different content to either Mac or Windows users (ie. software download link for different platforms), you can paste the following code into your themes functions.php file. You can easily change the content of the function to your own needs.<?php if (stristr($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'],\"mac\")) { echo \u2018Hello, I\\\u2019m a Mac.\u2019; } else { echo \u2018And I\\\u2019m a PC.\u2019; } ?>Source \u2192You might also like\u202620 Plugin Replacing Tutorials, Tips, Snippets and Solutions for WordPress \u2192 Dummy Content Filler Resources for WordPress, Drupal and Joomla Developers \u2192 10 Useful WordPress Search Code Snippets \u2192 30 Grid-Based WordPress Themes \u2192 40 More Stylish, Minimal and Clean Free WordPress Themes \u2192 20+ Free and Stylish Typography WordPress Themes \u2192 30 Brand New Quality WordPress Themes \u2192 10 Blank/Naked WordPress Themes Perfect for Development \u2192 25 Fresh, Clean and Unique WordPress Themes \u2192 40 Awesome and Fresh WordPress Themes \u2192 Essential WordPress Plugin Development Resources, Tutorials and Guides \u2192 20+ Powerful WordPress Security Plugins and Some Tips and Tricks \u2192About the Author: SmashinGeek (1 Articles) SmashinGeek is a Web Designer and loves to Write Articles.

Progressive enhancement uses web technologies in a layered fashion that allows everyone to access the basic content and functionality of a web page, using any browser or Internet connection, while also providing those with better bandwidth, more advanced browser software or more experience an enhanced version of the page. Contents 1 History 2 Introduction and background 3 Core principles 4 Support and adoption 5 Benefits for accessibility 6 Benefits for search engine optimization (SEO) 7 Criticism and responses 8 See also 9 Notes 10 References 11 Further reading 12 External links [edit] History \"Progressive Enhancement\" was coined by Steven Champeon of hesketh.com in a series of articles and presentations for Webmonkey and the SXSW Interactive conference between March and June 2003.[1][2] [edit] Introduction and background The strategy is an attempt to subvert the traditional web design strategy known as \"graceful degradation\", wherein designers would create Web pages for the latest browsers that would also work well in older versions of browser software. Graceful degradation was supposed to allow the page to \"degrade\", or remain presentable even if certain technologies assumed by the design were not present, without being jarring to the user of such older software. In practice, graceful degradation has been supplanted by an attitude that the end user should \"just upgrade\".[citation needed] This attitude is due to time and budget constraints, limited access to testing alternate browser software, as well as the widespread belief that \"browsers are free\". Unfortunately, upgrading is often not possible due to IT department policies, older hardware, and other reasons. The \"just upgrade\" attitude also ignores deliberate user choices and the existence of a variety of browser platforms; many of which run on handhelds or in other contexts where available bandwidth is restricted, or where support for sound or color and limited screen size, for instance, are far different from the typical graphical desktop browser. However there is also a large group of internet users unaware or uncaring about the features of the browser. In Progressive Enhancement (PE) the strategy is deliberately reversed: a basic markup document is created, geared towards the lowest common denominator of browser software functionality, and then the designer adds in functionality or enhancements to the presentation and behavior of the page, using modern technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets or JavaScript (or other advanced technologies, such as Flash or Java applets or SVG, etc.) All such enhancements are externally linked, preventing data unusable by certain browsers from being unnecessarily downloaded. The PE approach is derived from Champeon's early experience (c. 1993-4) with SGML, before working with HTML or any Web presentation languages, as well as from later experiences working with CSS to work around browser bugs. In those early SGML contexts, semantic markup was of key importance, whereas presentation was nearly always considered separately, rather than being embedded in the markup itself. This concept is variously referred to in markup circles as the rule of separation of presentation and content, separation of content and style, or of separation of semantics and presentation. As the Web evolved in the mid-nineties, but before CSS was introduced and widely supported, this cardinal rule of SGML was repeatedly violated by HTML's extenders. As a result, web designers were forced to adopt new, disruptive technologies and tags in order to remain relevant. With a nod to graceful degradation, in recognition that not everyone had the latest browser, many began to simply adopt design practices and technologies only supported in the most recent and perhaps the single previous major browser releases. For several years, much of the Web simply did not work in anything but the most recent, most popular browsers. This remained true until the rise and widespread adoption of and support for CSS, as well as many populist, grassroots educational efforts (from Eric Costello, Owen Briggs, Dave Shea, and others) showing Web designers how to use CSS for layout purposes. PE is based on a recognition that the core assumption behind \"graceful degradation\" \u2014 that browsers always got faster and more powerful \u2014 was proving itself false with the rise of handheld and PDA devices with low-functionality browsers and serious bandwidth constraints. In addition, the rapid evolution of HTML and related technologies in the early days of the Web has slowed, and very old browsers have become obsolete, freeing designers to use powerful technologies such as CSS to manage all presentation tasks and JavaScript to enhance complex client-side behavior. First proposed as a somewhat less unwieldy catchall phrase to describe the delicate art of \"separating document structure and contents from semantics, presentation, and behavior\", and based on the then-common use of CSS hacks to work around rendering bugs in specific browsers, the PE strategy has taken on a life of its own as new designers have embraced the idea and extended and revised the approach. [edit] Core principles Progressive Enhancement consists of the following core principles: basic content should be accessible to all browsers basic functionality should be accessible to all browsers sparse, semantic markup contains all content enhanced layout is provided by externally linked CSS enhanced behavior is provided by unobtrusive, externally linked JavaScript end user browser preferences are respected [edit] Support and adoption Jim Wilkinson created a page for Progressive Enhancement Wiki to collect some tricks and tips and to explain the overall strategy.[3] Designers such as Jeremy Keith have shown how the approach can be used harmoniously with still other approaches to modern Web design (such as Ajax) to provide flexible, but powerful, user experiences.[4] Others, including Dave Shea, have helped to spread the adoption of the term to refer to CSS-based design strategies. Organizations such as the Web Standards Project have embraced PE as a basis for their educational efforts. In 2006 Nate Koechley at Yahoo! made extensive reference to PE in his own approach to Web design and browser support, Graded Browser Support (GBS).[5] Steve Chipman at AOL has referred to PE as a basis for his Web design strategy.[6] David Artz, leader of the AOL Optimization team, developed a suite of Accessible Rendering Technologies, and invented a technique for disassembly of the \u201cenhancement\u201d on the fly, saving the user's preference. Chris Heilmann discusses the importance of targeted delivery of CSS so that each browser only gets the content (and enhancements) it can handle.[7] Scott Jehl of Filament Group introduces \"Test-Driven Progressive Enhancement\" on A List Apart. The article proposes testing browser capabilities (rather than user-agent detection) before applying enhancements, to ensure a usable experience to the largest audience possible. Ideas in this article led to creation of the EnhanceJS framework.[8] Wt is a web application library which transparently implements progressive enhancement during its bootstrap, progressing from plain HTML to full AJAX. EnhanceJS is a Javascript framework maintained by Filament Group designed to improve the application of Progressive Enhancement by first testing browser capabilities for key Javascript and CSS support before applying advanced styles and scripts to the page. [edit] Benefits for accessibility Web pages created according to the principles of PE are by their nature more accessible, because the strategy demands that basic content always be available, not obstructed by commonly unsupported or easily disabled scripting. Additionally, the sparse markup principle makes it easier for tools that read content aloud to find that content. It is unclear as to how well PE sites work with older tools designed to deal with table layouts, \"tag soup,\" and the like. [edit] Benefits for search engine optimization (SEO) Improved results with respect to Search Engine Optimization is another side effect of a PE-based Web design strategy. Because the basic content is always accessible to search engine spiders, pages built with PE methods avoid problems that may hinder search engine indexing[9]. [edit] Criticism and responses Some skeptics, such as Garret Dimon, have expressed their concern that PE is not workable in situations that rely heavily on JavaScript to achieve certain user interface presentations or behaviors.[10] Others have countered with the point that informational pages should be coded using PE in order to be indexed by spiders,[11] and that even Flash-heavy pages should be coded using PE.[12] In a related area, many have expressed their doubts concerning the principle of the separation of content and presentation in absolute terms, pushing instead for a realistic recognition that the two are inextricably linked.[13][14] [edit] See also Unobtrusive JavaScript Ajax Graceful degradation Liquid layout Semantic HTML [edit] Notes ^ Champeon, Steven (2003), Progressive Enhancement and the Future of Web Design, Webmonkey ^ Champeon, Steven & Finck, Nick (2003) Inclusive Web Design for the Future, SxSWi presentation ^ Wilkinson, Jim (2003), CSS-Discuss Wiki page on Progressive Enhancement ^ Adactio, Progressive Enhancement with AJAX ^ Nate Koechley, Graded Browser Support ^ Steven G.

The second section provides general guidance for the application of the system while recognizing that the details of application may vary depending on the circumstances of the food operation[1].The HACCP system, which is science based and systematic, identifies specific hazards and measures for their control to ensure the safety of food. HACCP is a tool to assess hazards and establish control systems that focus on prevention rather than relying mainly on end-product testing. Any HACCP system is capable of accommodating change, such as advances in equipment design, processing procedures or technological developments.HACCP can be applied throughout the food chain from primary production to final consumption and its implementation should be guided by scientific evidence of risks to human health. As well as enhancing food safety, implementation of HACCP can provide other significant benefits. In addition, the application of HACCP systems can aid inspection by regulatory authorities and promote international trade by increasing confidence in food safety.The successful application of HACCP requires the full commitment and involvement of management and the work force. It also requires a multidisciplinary approach; this multidisciplinary approach should include, when appropriate, expertise in agronomy, veterinary health, production, microbiology, medicine, public health, food technology, environmental health, chemistry and engineering, according to the particular study. The application of HACCP is compatible with the implementation of quality management systems, such as the ISO 9000 series, and is the system of choice in the management of food safety within such systems.While the application of HACCP to food safety was considered here, the concept can be applied to other aspects of food quality.DEFINITIONSControl (verb): To take all necessary actions to ensure and maintain compliance with criteria established in the HACCP plan.Control (noun): The state wherein correct procedures are being followed and criteria are being met.Control measure: Any action and activity that can be used to prevent or eliminate a food safety hazard or reduce it to an acceptable level.Corrective action: Any action to be taken when the results of monitoring at the CCP indicate a loss of control.Critical Control Point (CCP): A step at which control can be applied and is essential to prevent or eliminate a food safety hazard or reduce it to an acceptable level.Critical limit: A criterion which separates acceptability from unacceptability.Deviation: Failure to meet a critical limit.Flow diagram: A systematic representation of the sequence of steps or operations used in the production or manufacture of a particular food item.HACCP: A system which identifies, evaluates, and controls hazards which are significant for food safety.HACCP plan: A document prepared in accordance with the principles of HACCP to ensure control of hazards which are significant for food safety in the segment of the food chain under consideration.Hazard: A biological, chemical or physical agent in, or condition of, food with the potential to cause an adverse health effect.Hazard analysis: The process of collecting and evaluating information on hazards and conditions leading to their presence to decide which are significant for food safety and therefore should be addressed in the HACCP plan.Monitor: The act of conducting a planned sequence of observations or measurements of control parameters to assess whether a CCP is under control.Step: A point, procedure, operation or stage in the food chain including raw materials, from primary production to final consumption.Validation: Obtaining evidence that the elements of the HACCP plan are effective.Verification: The application of methods, procedures, tests and other evaluations, in addition to monitoring to determine compliance with the HACCP plan.PRINCIPLES OF THE HACCP SYSTEMThe HACCP system consists of the following seven principles:PRINCIPLE 1Conduct a hazard analysis.PRINCIPLE 2Determine the Critical Control Points (CCPs).PRINCIPLE 3Establish critical limit(s).PRINCIPLE 4Establish a system to monitor control of the CCP.PRINCIPLE 5Establish the corrective action to be taken when monitoring indicates that a particular CCP is not under control.PRINCIPLE 6Establish procedures for verification to confirm that the HACCP system is working effectively.PRINCIPLE 7Establish documentation concerning all procedures and records appropriate to these principles and their application.GUIDELINES FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE HACCP SYSTEMPrior to application of HACCP to any sector of the food chain, that sector should be operating according to the Codex General Principles of Food Hygiene, the appropriate Codex Codes of Practice, and appropriate food safety legislation. Management commitment is necessary for implementation of an effective HACCP system. During hazard identification, evaluation, and subsequent operations in designing and applying HACCP systems, consideration must be given to the impact of raw materials, ingredients, food manufacturing practices, role of manufacturing processes to control hazards, likely end-use of the product, categories of consumers of concern, and epidemiological evidence relative to food safety.The intent of the HACCP system is to focus control at CCPs. Redesign of the operation should be considered if a hazard which must be controlled is identified but no CCPs are found.HACCP should be applied to each specific operation separately. CCPs identified in any given example in any Codex Code of Hygienic Practice might not be the only ones identified for a specific application or might be of a different nature.The HACCP application should be reviewed and necessary changes made when any modification is made in the product, process, or any step.It is important when applying HACCP to be flexible where appropriate, given the context of the application taking into account the nature and the size of the operation.APPLICATIONThe application of HACCP principles consists of the following tasks as identified in the Logic Sequence for Application of HACCP (Diagram 1).1. Assemble HACCP teamThe food operation should assure that the appropriate product specific knowledge and expertise is available for the development of an effective HACCP plan. Optimally, this may be accomplished by assembling a multidisciplinary team. Where such expertise is not available on site, expert advice should be obtained from other sources. The scope of the HACCP plan should be identified. The scope should describe which segment of the food chain is involved and the general classes of hazards to be addressed (e.g. does it cover all classes of hazards or only selected classes).2. Describe productA full description of the product should be drawn up, including relevant safety information such as: composition, physical/chemical structure (including Aw, pH, etc.), microcidal/static treatments (heat-treatment, freezing, brining, smoking, etc.), packaging, durability and storage conditions and method of distribution.3. Identify intended useThe intended use should be based on the expected uses of the product by the end user or consumer. In specific cases, vulnerable groups of the population, e.g. institutional feeding, may have to be considered.4. Construct flow diagramThe flow diagram should be constructed by the HACCP team. The flow diagram should cover all steps in the operation. When applying HACCP to a given operation, consideration should be given to steps preceding and following the specified operation.5. On-site confirmation of flow diagramThe HACCP team should confirm the processing operation against the flow diagram during all stages and hours of operation and amend the flow diagram where appropriate.6. List all potential hazards associated with each step, conduct a hazard analysis, and consider any measures to control identified hazards(SEE PRINCIPLE 1)The HACCP team should list all of the hazards that may be reasonably expected to occur at each step from primary production, processing, manufacture, and distribution until the point of consumption.The HACCP team should next conduct a hazard analysis to identify for the HACCP plan which hazards are of such a nature that their elimination or reduction to acceptable levels is essential to the production of a safe food.In conducting the hazard analysis, wherever possible the following should be included: the likely occurrence of hazards and severity of their adverse health effects; the qualitative and/or quantitative evaluation of the presence of hazards; survival or multiplication of microorganisms of concern; production or persistence in foods of toxins, chemicals or physical agents; and, conditions leading to the above. The HACCP team must then consider what control measures, if any, exist which can be applied for each hazard.More than one control measure may be required to control a specific hazard(s) and more than one hazard may be controlled by a specified control measure. 7. Determine Critical Control Points (SEE PRINCIPLE 2)[2] There may be more than one CCP at which control is applied to address the same hazard. The determination of a CCP in the HACCP system can be facilitated by the application of a decision tree (e.g. Diagram 2), which indicates a logic reasoning approach. Application of a decision tree should be flexible, given whether the operation is for production, slaughter, processing, storage, distribution or other. It should be used for guidance when determining CCPs. This example of a decision tree may not be applicable to all situations. Other approaches may be used. Training in the application of the decision tree is recommended.If a hazard has been identified at a step where control is necessary for safety, and no control measure exists at that step, or any other, then the product or process should be modified at that step, or at any earlier or later stage, to include a control measure.8. Establish critical limits for each CCP(SEE PRINCIPLE 3)Critical limits must be specified and validated if possible for each Critical Control Point. In some cases more than one critical limit will be elaborated at a particular step. Criteria often used include measurements of temperature, time, moisture level, pH, Aw, available chlorine, and sensory parameters such as visual appearance and texture.9. Establish a monitoring system for each CCP(SEE PRINCIPLE 4)Monitoring is the scheduled measurement or observation of a CCP relative to its critical limits. The monitoring procedures must be able to detect loss of control at the CCP. Further, monitoring should ideally provide this information in time to make adjustments to ensure control of the process to prevent violating the critical limits. Where possible, process adjustments should be made when monitoring results indicate a trend towards loss of control at a CCP. The adjustments should be taken before a deviation occurs. Data derived from monitoring must be evaluated by a designated person with knowledge and authority to carry out corrective actions when indicated. If monitoring is not continuous, then the amount or frequency of monitoring must be sufficient to guarantee the CCP is in control. Most monitoring procedures for CCPs will need to be done rapidly because they relate to on-line processes and there will not be time for lengthy analytical testing. Physical and chemical measurements are often preferred to microbiological testing because they may be done rapidly and can often indicate the microbiological control of the product. All records and documents associated with monitoring CCPs must be signed by the person(s) doing the monitoring and by a responsible reviewing official(s) of the company.10. Establish corrective actions(SEE PRINCIPLE 5)Specific corrective actions must be developed for each CCP in the HACCP system in order to deal with deviations when they occur.The actions must ensure that the CCP has been brought under control. Actions taken must also include proper disposition of the affected product. Deviation and product disposition procedures must be documented in the HACCP record keeping.11. Establish verification procedures(SEE PRINCIPLE 6)Establish procedures for verification. Verification and auditing methods, procedures and tests, including random sampling and analysis, can be used to determine if the HACCP system is working correctly. The frequency of verification should be sufficient to confirm that the HACCP system is working effectively. Examples of verification activities include: Review of the HACCP system and its records; Review of deviations and product dispositions; Confirmation that CCPs are kept under control. Where possible, validation activities should include actions to confirm the efficacy of all elements of the HACCP plan.12. Establish Documentation and Record Keeping(SEE PRINCIPLE 7)Efficient and accurate record keeping is essential to the application of a HACCP system. HACCP procedures should be documented. Documentation and record keeping should be appropriate to the nature and size of the operation.Documentation examples are: Hazard analysis; CCP determination; Critical limit determination. Record examples are: CCP monitoring activities; Deviations and associated corrective actions; Modifications to the HACCP system. An example of a HACCP worksheet is attached as Diagram 3.TRAININGTraining of personnel in industry, government and academia in HACCP principles and applications, and increasing awareness of consumers are essential elements for the effective implementation of HACCP. As an aid in developing specific training to support a HACCP plan, working instructions and procedures should be developed which define the tasks of the operating personnel to be stationed at each Critical Control Point.Cooperation between primary producer, industry, trade groups, consumer organizations, and responsible authorities is of vital importance. Opportunities should be provided for the joint training of industry and control authorities to encourage and maintain a continuous dialogue and create a climate of understanding in the practical application of HACCP. DIAGRAM 1. LOGIC SEQUENCE FOR THE APPLICATION OF HACCP DIAGRAM 2. EXAMPLE OF DECISION TREE TO IDENTIFY CCPS (answer questions in sequence) DIAGRAM 3. EXAMPLE OF A HACCP WORKSHEET [1] The Principles of the HACCP System set the basis for the requirements for the application of HACCP, while the Guidelines for the Application provide general guidance for practical application. [2] Since the publication of the decision tree by Codex, its use has been implemented many times for training purposes. In many instances, while this tree has been useful to explain the logic and depth of understanding needed to determine CCPs, it is not specific to all food operations, e.g. slaughter, and therefore it should be used in conjunction with professional judgement, and modified in some cases.

Se voc\u00ea acompanha o que se passa nas edi\u00e7\u00f5es dos EUA, j\u00e1 sabe que o Tocha Humanda bateu as botas na Zona Negativa e que o grupo Quarteto Fant\u00e1stico terminou na edi\u00e7\u00e3o 588, l\u00e1 fora. Agora, a Marvel anunciou a revista Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Futuro (Future Foundation) n\u00famero 1 e soltou novas informa\u00e7\u00f5es dessa nova fase. A participa\u00e7\u00e3o de outros personagens no Quarteto Fant\u00e1stico j\u00e1 n\u00e3o era novidade, mas agora com a Future Foundation isso ocorrer\u00e1 de forma mais natural, visto que o grupo n\u00e3o fica mais restrito a quatro membros. Assim, voc\u00ea ver\u00e1 nessas p\u00e1ginas o Homem-Aranha, os irm\u00e3os Franklin (com seus poderes de volta) e Valeria Richards, al\u00e9m de Mulher-Hulk, Homem-Drag\u00e3o, Alex Power (Quarteto Futuro), Leech e outros. O foco agora estar\u00e1 nas descobertas cient\u00edficas e nos conflitos familiares, com isso, eles ter\u00e3o mais tempo para participar de quest\u00f5es importantes do Universo 616 da Marvel. Eu acho que vai ficar bem \u201cboring\u201d. \u00c9 uma ideia ousada e o Homem-Aranha s\u00f3 est\u00e1 a\u00ed para atrair os mais incautos e vender revistas. Essa hist\u00f3ria de descobertas cient\u00edficas maravilhosas valia a pena na d\u00e9cada de 40, 50 ou 60, quando a ci\u00eancia ainda era um grande mist\u00e9rio. Future Foundation #1 chega \u00e0s lojas americanas em mar\u00e7o, com roteiros de Jonathan Hickman. Quadrinhos Coment\u00e1rios \u00bb TEDxRio traz tecnologia e entretenimento para o RJ 15 de February de 2011 por Pedro Cardoso Informe Publicit\u00e1rio O Rio de Janeiro sedia, neste dia 15 de fevereiro, mais uma edi\u00e7\u00e3o do TEDxRio. Trata-se de um evento que re\u00fane profissionais e pensadores do entretenimento, tecnologia e design. Caso voc\u00ea n\u00e3o tenha conseguido um convite, mas quer acompanhar ao vivo as palestras, est\u00e1 no ar o site Feito Para Voc\u00ea, do Ita\u00fa (um dos patrocinadores do evento). Se pensarmos os formatos das palestras tradicionais, o TED \u00e9 bem inovador. Cada palestrante sobe ao palco e transmite seu conhecimento por apenas 15 minutos, sem direito a perguntas do p\u00fablico. Assim, o n\u00famero de palestrantes \u00e9 bem maior do que em eventos normais. Em espec\u00edfico neste TEDxRio, ser\u00e3o 22 palestrantes divididos em 4 blocos. Entre os convidados est\u00e3o Arm\u00ednio Fraga (economista e professor), Andr\u00e9 Urani (pesquisador e fundador do IETS), Oskar Metsavaht (refer\u00eancia nas \u00e1reas de moda, a\u00e7\u00f5es socioambientais e expedi\u00e7\u00f5es), Rosa C\u00e9lia (Fundadora e diretora do projeto Pr\u00f3 Crian\u00e7a Card\u00edaca), entre outros. Carreira, Web Coment\u00e1rios \u00bb Activision anuncia o fim do Guitar Hero 9 de February de 2011 por Pedro Cardoso Uma not\u00edcia caiu como uma bomba no mundo dos games na noite desta quarta-feira (9), quando a Activision-Blizzard anunciou o cancelamento da s\u00e9rie Guitar Hero por queda nas vendas. No mesmo comunicado, a empresa afirmou que a s\u00e9rie True Crime tamb\u00e9m foi cancelada, deste modo, as edi\u00e7\u00f5es deste ano que est\u00e3o em desenvolvimento ser\u00e3o abandonadas, como True Crime: Hong Kong. Para muitos especialistas, Rock Band vem se tornado um jogo de m\u00fasica muito mais consistente do que o seu rival. E isso se traduziu no Rock Band 3, que foi muito bem aceito pelo p\u00fablico e pela cr\u00edtica. Especula\u00e7\u00f5es a parte, o certo \u00e9 que Guitar Hero j\u00e1 n\u00e3o vinha vendendo como antes.

It\u2019s an online business to business and business to consumer payments provider, we\u2019ve confirmed. \u201cHow is it different than PayPal or Google Checkout?\u201d I asked someone who\u2019s seen the product. Their answer \u2013 \u201cIt doesn\u2019t suck.\u201d Developers have a lot of trouble getting the various payments parts to work properly \u2013 from getting a merchant account to making the software work properly on your website. And then there is fee gouging. Stripe is said to make the process very, very easy for developers. Apparently Stripe really doesn\u2019t suck, because the company has taken approximately $2 million in a venture round from PayPal founders Peter Thiel and Elon Musk, as well as Sequoia Capital, Andreesen Horowitz and SV Angel. Stripe was valued at around $20 million in the round, we\u2019ve heard but haven\u2019t confirmed. The company wouldn\u2019t comment on whether or not the financing occurred at all. Sequoia partner Michael Moritz is said to be personally involved in Stripe as well. He\u2019s not known to spend a lot of time on startups he doesn\u2019t think will have huge exits.

Nearly every detail of the photo shoot was handmade. So, we wanted to share our absolute favorite DIY project with you, sweet friends!\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the messiest, merriest and whirliest DIY balls Now you can't say we didn't warn you. The level of messiness involved in this project definitely warrants the great outdoors or a tarp covered floor in your home. However, I think you will find that the fun you had along the way and the final product makes the mess completely worth it!\u00a0 Gather up: Big balloon Sharpie Scissors Cotton yarn 4 oz. White school glue 1/2 cup of Corn starch 1/4 cup of Warm water Something to stir with Petroleum jelly Clear fast drying spray paint Hanging lamp cord or fishing line (depending on your desired final product) Container for mixing Directions \u00a0Blow up a balloon. We kind of suggest not blowing it up to its maximum capacity so that it is rounder. After the balloon is inflated to it's desired size draw a circle with the sharpie around the balloon knot just large enough to accommodate whatever lighting method you choose. Note:\u00a0If you are just wanting to hang the balls or use them in a vase then you don't need to leave a hole at all! You will need to prepare your work area by laying down a tarp. We hung a shower curtain between two chairs and suspended the balloons by it with string so we could have plenty of working room. Mix corn starch, glue and warm water together until it's not lumpy (too bad getting rid of cellulite isn't this easy).\u00a0 Smear the petroleum jelly all over your balloon until it is completely coated. Note: We specifically left using rubber gloves out of these instructions. You should get messy. If we were concerned about keeping your hands clean this would have been called the \"loveliest, merriest and whirliest DIY\" not \"messiest, merriest and whirliest DIY\". Besides sharing in good company, it will go much faster if you have a friend help you with this. One of you begin feeding the yarn through the glue mix and handing it off to the other person to drape around the ball. Tuck the start and end pieces of yarn beneath other pieces of yarn. Begin wrapping the yarn around the balloon vertically at a comfortable tightness, and gradually switch to wrapping horizontally. After your ball has dried for 24 hours, you can pop the balloon! Use a chopstick to knock out any glue crystals that developed between strings. Spray the ball with clear fast drying spray paint outdoors. Now let there be light, fishing wire from the ceiling, or something pretty to put in a vase!\u00a0 Instructions for making the sweet little flowers that are in the yarn balls above! We do hope you found as much laughter and fun through this craft as we did! Comments Love these! I am totally going to make them for my wedding next summer! Very creative! - by Nicole on Nov 8, 2010 at 1:28 PM Do you think kids could make these? - by Rhonda on Nov 9, 2010 at 7:57 PM Oh I think it would be fun to do with kids, but it just needs to be the right setting. It is unbelievably messy, but the mess is part of the fun! - by Garett Mayfield on Nov 9, 2010 at 10:59 PM Hey guys, this is amazing!!! we posted on www.bluecolibri.com facebook page for our fans to see it too. Thanks - by Gee on Nov 17, 2010 at 6:47 PM I've been wanting to do this project for a while, but now I'm really inspired with the way you've grouped them together, love the look, thanks so much! - by creativejewishmom/sara on Nov 18, 2010 at 1:28 AM Do you this this would work with colored string too? - by Hannah on Nov 18, 2010 at 7:27 AM This is such a great idea! - by Erin D on Nov 18, 2010 at 11:48 AM Supper cool. Garett!!!! Great to see the incredible work you are doing. Really beautiful. Let me know how things are going. I hear you are in Florida but I don't know where. Congratulations on everything. PS, if you make it back to Abilene for any reason make sure you bring some work and talk to our students a bit. - by Mike Wiggins on Nov 18, 2010 at 9:05 PM Thank you guys!! Hannah, I think it would look incredible with colored string! You should try it, and please send us pictures - by Garett Mayfield on Nov 18, 2010 at 9:47 PM Hello, aussie here. I've used \"white school glue\", but I have a feeling it's different from your white school glue. Ours is a glaggy, wheat starch glue and I have a hunch that the glue you've used is more like a gummy glue. Could you clarify please? I really love this idea but the mock-ups I've made for fiance haven't been terribly successful :( - by Kathryn on Nov 20, 2010 at 4:56 AM Kathryn, Yes we used Elmer's School Glue, Corn Starch, and Water. The trick is to add the water slowly, stir for a while, analyze the consistency of the glue and then add more water if it is still too thick. Just be careful not to add too much water, because then it can get very runny. And make sure that the Starch that you add is broken down so that there are no \"clumps\" in the mix. I hope that helps. - by Jessica Mayfield on Nov 20, 2010 at 10:13 AM That's very helpful, thank you! It was a very thick consistency and there are dried clumps in between bits of string. But for the next batch, I'll make it a little runnier. Thank you again! And for sharing such a great idea!! :D - by Kathryn on Nov 20, 2010 at 11:00 PM So creative! I'm going to use this idea for an upcoming Christmas Winter Wonderland Party... Thanks! - by Leah on Nov 22, 2010 at 7:27 PM These look so awesome. I wonder how'd they go with a different kind of string, like a synthetic. Maybe some glue with a little water... Kathryn, as far as I'm aware, elmer's is a not too strong pva glue. Hope this helps - by Suzanne on Nov 23, 2010 at 8:37 PM They look like dewdrops after a spring rain...just adorable! Thanks for the post. - by Margaret Ivory - Ivory Pearl Bridal Mall on Nov 26, 2010 at 9:26 AM Question: Why not use Fabric Stiffener on the yarn instead of the Elmer's School Glue, Corn Starch, and Water concoction? Just curious... - by L on Nov 29, 2010 at 10:02 AM Amazing! I will be making these for our wedding after Christmas!! Can't wait - by Danielle on Dec 5, 2010 at 7:24 PM Do you think you can put lights in these? - by Sacha on Jan 6, 2011 at 11:25 AM you made this look so easy... i tried this and it definitely did not look this clean. /: - by katie on Jan 11, 2011 at 2:53 AM My after school recycled art program made these with kids last year and they were great. The kids had a wonderful time and the finished project was beautiful. @Sacha - I think you could put lights in, but regular fairy/Christmas lights might be too heavy. There are small, battery powered lights called Balloominators (sp?) that are lightweight. - by Leah on Jan 24, 2011 at 6:41 AM I would love to use these for my wedding instead of a regular round paper lanterns. Are the balls hard when they dry, or do they stay soft from the glue? I have a destination wedding and I'm wondering if I would be able to make these at home and ship them in a box to where my wedding reception will be. Hoping these fold in easily so I can pack them in a box... What do you think? - by Cindy on Feb 2, 2011 at 4:19 PM Cindy, They are hard when they dry. You might try to fold one, but I doubt it will return to it's original round shape when you open it back up. If you could find some sort of elastic glue it might work, but it is doubtful. If you do find a way to make that work, we would love to hear about it or see photos! Good luck at your wedding! - by Garett Mayfield on Feb 2, 2011 at 5:36 PM I'm just curious how many balls the 4 oz glue-.5cup starch-.25cup water recipe makes? Also, how much string do you use up for a medium sized ball? - by Jackie on Feb 3, 2011 at 3:21 PM Jackie, It really depends on the size of the balls you are making. The same goes for the string. It all depends on how much space you want in between your strands of string. You can make the string lanterns as thick or as minimal as you like. *1 warning though: Be careful about the amount of glue you have on your string when wrapping the balloons. When it dries, it may take you a long time to knock the extra glue that is remaining in between the strands. It can also cause the balloon to become too heavy and pop while hanging there drying. - by Garett Mayfield on Feb 3, 2011 at 7:35 PM Great idea, i made it too. - by Nick on Feb 8, 2011 at 2:13 PM Hi, Has anyone used colored string or yarn to do this?? I was thinking that if they could be covered in pastel colors and dusted with a very fine glitter they would be pretty easter decorations. Any input?? Thanks, Marybeth - by Marybeth on Feb 8, 2011 at 10:16 PM Yesterday I saw similar designs in my village, really inspiring stuff, thank you for sharing!! - by Maori inspired tattoo designs on Feb 13, 2011 at 12:40 AM Does anyone know how long these last? My wedding is in August and I'd like to make a whole bunch beforehand to save time. Also, what is the clear fast drying paint for? - by Amy Johnson on Feb 14, 2011 at 4:41 PM Marybeth, I love your idea of using these for an Easter decoration! If you decide to try it with a colored yarn, please send us a photo! I'd love to see how it turned out. Amy, since making these in October, these have survived a full day outdoors, the garage, a move, and they are now hanging as lovely today in our home as they did the first day we made them! The clear fast drying paint actually helps with the durability. If you are planning on making them far in advance I would be sure to use that step! You'll have to send us a photo of them at your wedding! Happy crafting! - by Garett Mayfield on Feb 15, 2011 at 8:51 PM So pretty!! I've been searching for a cheap, but elegant centerpiece for my wedding! I'm going to spray paint them in turquoise and black and stack them in vases! Thanks so much for the affordable idea!! - by Erika Borrodell on Feb 16, 2011 at 1:24 AM its the best party balls - by Wallpaper on Feb 17, 2011 at 1:15 PM I made these in second grade 40 years ago. - by Joe on Feb 17, 2011 at 7:53 PM My daughter are on there way to The Wharehouse to gather up all they need. Looks like a messy night ahead but what a cool thing to make & really pretty. - by Louise on Feb 18, 2011 at 12:02 AM These are so pretty; I love crafty stuff like this to hang around my dorm room. Do you think that ModPodge could be substituted for the glue+water mixture, but still add the corn starch? I guess I'm wondering how liquidy the glue needs to be. Also, for a more rustic look I think that using twine could be interesting. In that case though the corn starch might alter the color; otherwise Elmer's glue dries clear. Thanks! - by Caroline on Feb 21, 2011 at 12:12 AM My daughter loves this idea. She is getting married this Christmas and these will look like snowballs hanging from the ceiling! This is a great idea and we plan to make them with a white yarn with silver threads running through it! - by Lori on Feb 21, 2011 at 7:07 PM How long do these last? If you dry them up do they last forever or do they eventually just kinda fall apart? I wanna make these for my dorm in college next fall to be hung in a corner above my bed. - by Martha on Feb 28, 2011 at 12:44 AM This was just what I was on the look for. I\u2019ll come back to this blog for sure! - by pavle on Mar 3, 2011 at 4:39 PM I do a lot of catering, so I'll keep these in mind for the next wedding I do. Thanks! Who knew a little project I did in elementary school would be useful later? Awesome! - by Brandon on Mar 4, 2011 at 6:44 PM Fantastic - by Cass on Mar 10, 2011 at 7:00 AM i really want to try these! i live in south africa and we have totally different brands of glue. is elmers white school glue similar to wood glue? - by ciara on Mar 10, 2011 at 9:14 AM I remember we got to make these when I was in elementary school. - by Amber Christmas on Mar 13, 2011 at 12:46 PM Absolutely fabulous idea! Love it! - by Cate Holst on Mar 15, 2011 at 1:55 PM These are fabulous, I have made these many times in the past, however instead of white glue, I used a mixture of water and sugar. When the mixture dries it hardens up, you get the same result as with glue, just not as messy. - by Suzanne on Mar 17, 2011 at 6:04 PM very nice! have a minute for the best at---> www.paleochora.com thank you - by akis on Mar 21, 2011 at 2:38 PM These are beautiful. They would be really cool to hang earings from. - by Rachel on Mar 26, 2011 at 12:42 PM I like the idea of water and sugar. It sounds like it would dry hard to me. That is what I'm looking for. I try it the other way and didn't have much luck. - by Vivian on Mar 26, 2011 at 8:56 PM Looks messy & fun! I love the results, will have to try this out! - by Angie on Mar 27, 2011 at 10:38 AM Leave a Comment Name: Email: URL: Comment: Subscribe to follow-ups?

If a stationary level of performance, consistent ability in executing a few limited skills is your goal, then engaging only in your sport will keep you there. However, if you want the utmost efficiency, consistent improvement, and balanced abilities sportsmen and women must participate in year round conditioning programs. The bottom line in sports conditioning and fitness training is stress, not mental stress, but adaptive body stress. Sportsmen and women must put their bodies under a certain amount of stress (overload) to increase physical capabilities. The Components of Fitness Health is a state of complete mental, physical and social well being where as fitness is the ability to meet the demands of a physical task. Basic fitness can be classified in four main components: strength, speed, stamina and flexibility. However, exercise scientists have identified nine components that comprise the definition of fitness: [Reference: Bill Tancred, \"Key Methods of Sports Conditioning\", Athletics Coach Vol 29 No 2 p19] Strength - the extent to which muscles can exert force by contracting against resistance (e.g. holding or restraining an object or person) Power - the ability to exert maximum muscular contraction instantly in an explosive burst of movements. The two components of power are strength and speed. (e.g. jumping or a sprint start) Agility - the ability to perform a series of explosive power movements in rapid succession in opposing directions (e.g. ZigZag running or cutting movements) Balance - the ability to control the body's position, either stationary (e.g. a handstand) or while moving (e.g. a gymnastics stunt) Flexibility - the ability to achieve an extended range of motion without being impeded by excess tissue, i.e. fat or muscle (e.g. executing a leg split) Local Muscle Endurance - a single muscle's ability to perform sustained work (e.g. rowing or cycling) Cardiovascular Endurance - the heart's ability to deliver blood to working muscles and their ability to use it (e.g. running long distances) Strength Endurance - a muscle's ability to perform a maximum contraction time after time (e.g. continuous explosive rebounding through an entire basketball game) Co-ordination- the ability to integrate the above listed components so that effective movements are achieved. Of all the nine elements of fitness cardiac respiratory qualities are the most important to develop as they enhance all the other components of the conditioning equation. Physical Fitness Physical fitness refers to the capacity of an athlete to meet the varied physical demands of their sport without reducing the athlete to a fatigued state. The components of physical fitness are: [Reference: Physical Education and the study of sport, B. Davies et al.] Body Composition Endurance Flexibility Strength Speed Motor Fitness Motor Fitness refers to the ability of an athlete to perform successfully at their sport. The components of motor fitness are: [Reference: Physical Education and the study of sport, B. Davies et al.] Agility Balance Co-ordination Power (speed & strength) Reaction Time Improving your condition Identify the most important fitness components for success in your sport or event and then design sport/event specific conditioning and training programs that will enhance these fitness components and energy systems.

At a Glance:Administration: Paper-and-pencil, computer, or Internet administration Administer to: Individuals 15 years and older Completion Time: 25 minutes (200 interest and 120 skill items, 6-point response scale) Reading Level: 6th grade Report Options: ProfileAges / Grades: 15 years and olderNorms: 5,225 working adultsLanguage: Available in Spanish Product Summary Overview Manage your CISS testing program on-line. Click here for a DEMO. The Campbell Interest and Skill Survey (CISS) measures self-reported vocational interests and skills. Similar to traditional interest inventories, the CISS interest scales reflect an individual's attraction for specific occupational areas. However, the CISS instrument goes beyond traditional inventories by adding parallel skill scales that provide estimates of an individual's confidence in his or her ability to perform various occupational activities. Together, the two types of scales provide more comprehensive, richer data than interest scores alone. The Internet version of the CISS survey, which includes an innovative test management system for counselors and an expanded CISS Career Planner, adds new dimension to this dynamic, popular instrument. The CISS instrument focuses on careers that require post-secondary education and is most appropriate for use with individuals who are college bound or college educated. How to Use This Instrument Counselors, psychologists, and human resource professionals in mental health, business, and educational settings can use the CISS survey to help: Explore new avenues in career development Pinpoint areas of academic study that can build skills and, as a result, increase career options Support personal counseling by identifying occupations or vocations that help meet the individual's needs Advise displaced and transitioning employees in outplacement programs Key Features The use of both traditional interest scales and parallel skill scales helps individuals gain a more thorough understanding of suitable career options. The CISS instrument uses easily understood, contemporary items. Test items reflect a respect for individuals of different gender, race, religion, and national origin. Combined gender scales allow for the broadest interpretation of survey results.

These orientations generally correspond to the familiar RIASEC themes. Basic ScalesThe 29 Basic Scales, which represent parallel interest and skills scores, divide the Orientation Scales into the following categories: Influencing: Leadership, Law/Politics, Public Speaking, Sales, Advertising/Marketing Organizing: Supervision, Financial Services, Office Practices Helping: Adult Development, Counseling, Child Development, Religious Activities, Medical Practice Creating: Art/Design, Performing Arts, Writing, International Activities, Fashion, Culinary Arts aNalyzing: Mathematics, Science Producing: Mechanical Crafts, Woodworking, Farming/Forestry, Plants/Gardens, Animal Care Adventuring: Athletics/Physical Fitness, Military/Law Enforcement, Risks/Adventure \u00a0 Norms The CISS instrument was standardized using a reference sample of 5,225 employed men and women representing a wide array of occupations and ethnic backgrounds. Report Option Individual Profile Report (Product Number 51456) The CISS results are presented both numerically and graphically and include narrative comments to facilitate easy interpretation by the respondent. In particular, the report recommends vocations that the respondent should pursue (high interest and high skill), avoid (low interest, low skill), explore (high skill, low interest) and develop (low skill, high interest). Also, a worksheet is available to facilitate action planning, and a two-page file summary is included for use by the career counselor.

View Comments How To Hack the New York Times Paywall \u2026 With Your Delete Key View Comments 50% of Tweets Consumed Come From Only 0.05% of Twitter Users [STUDY] March 28, 2011 by Brian Anthony Hernandez View Comments emailshareemailshare A mere 20,000 Twitter users steal almost half of the spotlight on Twitter, which now ropes in a billion tweets every week.That means only 0.05% of the social network\u2019s user base attracts attention, according to a new Yahoo Research study titled, \u201cWho Says What to Whom on Twitter.\u201dOf the 260 million tweets with URLs that the study\u2019s authors analyzed, nearly 50% of the tweets consumed were created by what they called \u201celite\u201d users who fall into four categories: media, celebrities, organizations and bloggers. \u201cOrdinary\u201d users encompass everyone else.Like findings in previous studies, the researchers for this one conclude Twitter resembles an information-sharing hub rather than a social network, with the top generators garnering huge follower tallies but not following their content consumers in return.Unlike previous studies though, this one delves deeper into the production and flow of tweets. For example, while ordinary users consume a high number of tweets from celebrities and bloggers, those celebrities primarily listen to other famous people\u2019s tweets and those bloggers listen to other bloggers on Twitter.\u201cBy studying the flow of information among the five categories \u2026 our analysis sheds new light on some old questions of communications research,\u201d the authors wrote in the 10-page study.For access to a PDF of the full study, click here.Do you think Twitter, which marked its fifth anniversary earlier this month, has evolved away from being a social network and transformed into just an information-sharing outlet? And if you think so, is that a good or bad thing?

Its like Facebook. 98% of posts are not seen. Meaning you are lucky if 2% of your friends followers or fans see your post due to the volume in the feed. It is a platform issue not a lazy or apathetic issue. http://www.facebook.com/steveleuniz Steve LeunizI definitely think it is more of an information-sharing outlet, not a social outlet. Facebook is a combination of the two. And are we supposed to be surprised at the revelation in this article that most celebrities follow other celebrities and don\u2019t follow back most of their followers? http://twitter.com/rabasure rabasureNo way,it seems that Twitter has no control over its ever growing users.Again twitter is also meant for sharing your contribution with others.Therefore, there is no use of accusing twitter. http://twitter.com/BarriosdeBogota Barrios de Bogot\u00e1Definitely more info sharing: one: many / authority:user AnonymousThis limits influence and visibility to those that Click on links (which is probably all advertisers care about). I personally read a lot of tweets from several sources, I don\u2019t always click on the links. But I read what\u2019s there, if it\u2019s a headline or something like that I\u2019m updated on that headline, even if I haven\u2019t gone forward to check all the details. Isn\u2019t that also important, and wouldn\u2019t that go against the notion that all tweets aren\u2019t read? Is it possible for Twitter to capture those stats? http://natts.com Dave NattrissTwitter was *never* a social network \u2013 as it describes itself, it is a \u2018real-time information network\u2019, and this just proves that. Most relationships on it (one-way follows) are not social. http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/twitter_is_not_a_social_network_says_twitter_exec.php http://natts.com Dave NattrissTwitter was *never* a social network \u2013 as it describes itself, it is a \u2018real-time information network\u2019, and this just proves that. Most relationships on it (one-way follows) are not social. http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/twitter_is_not_a_social_network_says_twitter_exec.php Reginald PinkstonInfo Sharing for sure. There\u2019s still a social networking feeling to it but it\u2019s people giving information to others that share that information http://natts.com Dave NattrissExcept that on Facebook, posts don\u2019t get seen because the default home page feed is just a set of highlights from the past few days, whereas on Twitter this home page stream is full and uninterrupted, but because people tweet so much it\u2019s rare that users read everything in it. http://natts.com Dave NattrissIt\u2019s meant for? Or do you mean, that\u2019s how it is often used? http://twitter.com/mathispayne T. Mathis-PayneI agree with Howie and Steve, it\u2019s kind of made that way. I never really imagined using Twitter for serious engagement. But it\u2019s still a social network in that people can still have conversations. After all, isn\u2019t \u201csocializing\u201d a form of information exchange to begin with? Twitter is still cool with me. http://natts.com Dave NattrissMuch more discussion (in both the article and comments) about defining Twitter: http://www.alchemyofchange.net/twitter-is-not-a-social-network/ http://twitter.com/mattbologna Matthew Bologna\u201cIt\u2019s a social network!\u201d vs \u201cIt\u2019s an information sharing network\u201d = It\u2019s a social information sharing network! Can we go home now? http://natts.com Dave NattrissWhat\u2019s social about it?! The vast majority of relationships (follows) are one-way only. http://twitter.com/charleymann Charley MannTwitter has really become just a micro-blogging site as it was originally intended. And just like the blogosphere, there are very few \u201csites\u201d that actually make it big. This may be an even greater extension of that idea. It has, like Facebook, become a great outlet for fan/consumer engagement, but the \u201csocial\u201d aspect is not as pure as some had projected. http://natts.com Dave Nattriss\u2018Become\u2019?! It always was just a way to share information in real-time. \u2018Social\u2019 is a two-way relationship, but Twitter by its very nature encourages one-way follows. http://twitter.com/reallynotarunnr Doug W.It completely depends on how you use it. I use it in a way that it serves as both information and social. I have made a lot of great IRL friends via twitter with common interests, and whole host of others who would be fast friends if/when we meet in person. But, as we have many common interests, we share a LOT of information. Like any outlet you get out of it what you put into it. http://www.facebook.com/deliverenz David WuMost people don\u2019t notice this on Facebook, but you can change your \u201cMost Recent\u201d feed to show everything by entering \u201cEdit Options\u201d and then selecting \u201cAll of your friends and pages\u201d.In addition, there is a huge difference between Facebook and Twitter because relationships are far more mutual. Facebook wanted to be about your \u201creal friends\u201d right from the get-go and that\u2019s partially why they have a 5K friend limit. You sort of have to agree that this helps stave off news and spam from people you really don\u2019t care much for, if you show some discretion in regards to who you add. http://twitter.com/Giftys Gifts and Gift IdeasBut Dave that\u2019s assuming that you can only have conversation with those that follow you. With \u201csearch\u201d, you can socialize with anyone. \u2013 We do it all the time. http://www.bullfrog-media.com Kriselle LaranThis mimics the actions of the offline world. In \u201creal\u201d life, only a small percentage of people actually contribute the bulk of the world\u2019s noticeable efforts. Looking at a smaller scale, take your local elementary school. Maybe 1% of the parents at a school make up about 85-90% of the volunteer work and fundraising efforts. Twitter\u2019s consumption rates are actually pretty good if you think about it. http://natts.com Dave NattrissIt happens but it\u2019s not that common. Most @replies are directed at users that the tweeter is following.blog comments powered by Disqus Subscribe To Mashable TwitterTwitter2,241,274+ Followers YouTube Stumble RSS RSS Feed530,022+ Subscribers Android iPhone iPad More subscription options \u00bb Advertise HereMashable News In Your Inbox Mashable Connect.

Oh god.The Silence of a Summer MorningPG, outsider POV, past deathfic, 2650 wordsMild spoilers for 5x10Title from Thomas de Quincey\u2019s Confessions of an English Opium-Eater.*People still call it Detroit, although I guess it hasn\u2019t really been Detroit for a long time. The name means something new now, though. When people say Detroit, they\u2019re not saying \u2018the city that used to be here\u2019; they\u2019re saying \u2018this place, here\u2019 and a million other things. So Detroit-the-name has stuck around, for all Detroit-the-city didn\u2019t.I was four when the Great Quake of Twenty-Ten happened. I don\u2019t remember anything much about it, or about the days before it. Sometimes mom or dad or uncle Jack would start talking about something from the befores \u2013 cellular phones, micro waved meals, em tee vee - and they\u2019d get a weird half-confused, half-amused look on their faces when I didn\u2019t know what it meant.You\u2019ve got to move with the times, I told them. Move with the times.Mom always said that one of the biggest surprises of everything that\u2019s happened since the changes was what happened to Detroit. On May 1 2010, it was a city and on May 2 2010, it was a smoking hole in the ground and Mom said everyone figured it was going to stay that way. Like a giant, black mark against all humanity. An ugly reminder of everything that changed. Nobody ever expected it to grow so beautiful.I know Dad pulled me out of class on the second anniversary and drove four hours, just the two of us, to the very edges of the outer fence. We stood there for a couple more hours, just holding onto the wire and staring inside, and then we got into the car and drove four hours back home. I remember the fence was hot to the touch, but I don\u2019t remember what the black hole looked like. Maybe all that demon residue messed with my memories the same way it messes with cameras. A little \u2018fuck you\u2019 left behind in the wake of their extinction.Dad took a couple pictures and stuck the weird, white-noise photographs in a frame. Like every other picture of Detroit since 2010, the most you can make out is a distorted kind of almost shape, and I remember asking him \u2013 me aged six and him arranging the photo frames on the mantelpiece \u2013 what the point was.\u201cTo remember, Gracie,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the point.\u201dA few years after that, the President declared May 2 a national holiday. It was officially called Detroit Remembrance Day, or sometimes the Day of Change, or sometimes just plain Winchester Day. Lately, kids have been calling it Independence Day, too. I\u2019ve never seen anybody correct them.Anyway, May 2 became a national holiday and the roadtrip Dad took me on became a traditional thing. He\u2019d always take his camera with him and document - in the same old warped and indecipherable shapes - the black hole\u2019s creeping fall to nature. He said that if you lined them all up, you could see the change. He said you could see the blackness give way to green. I never saw it, back then. Sometimes I told him that I could.Mom never saw it, either. Mom didn\u2019t really get it \u2013 what Dad had going on, I mean. Her and aunt Cathy had been close, I think, but nothing like what Dad and uncle Jack must have felt to lose her. She joined the local Friends of Possession support group and talked it all out and it was slow and painful, but she got over it. She didn\u2019t get Dad\u2019s obsession with Detroit. She didn\u2019t get the business cards him and uncle Jack printed out a few years after the change, almost indistinguishable from the cards for their software company except that these ones said \u2018Hunters.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t that big of a deal, really. I think everyone knows someone who\u2019s a Hunter, these days, and by \u201813 the change had settled in enough that people had stopped just rioting in the cemeteries, salt-and-burning every grave they could dig up fast enough, and Mom had started letting me play outside again. Obviously everyone knows the basics, even back then when people were still getting used to the idea, but not everyone can afford the grave-digging license fees and - let\u2019s face it - not everyone wants to dig up a whole freaking grave, anyway. So that\u2019s where my dad and uncle Jack came in, Thursdays to Saturdays, evenings by appointment. There\u2019s something comforting about brother Hunting duos. People seem to like it. I guess it makes them feel like there\u2019s a little bit of Winchester still walking the Earth, in the guise of Jack and Allan Taylor. I can give you their card, if you like.So Dad got me a silver dagger of my own for my thirteenth birthday and a couple weeks later, Mom asked for a divorce.It was quick and easy, if not quite amicable. The Judge figured that for all Dad was a well-respected member of the community, his second job was potentially hazardous and would also keep him out late at night, so Mom got custody of me and she moved us down to California. She got a little house in Shurley, one of those New Towns from after the change, with salt lines in the foundations and pre-painted runes. There was no cemetery, just a crematorium. No Hunters, either; just firefighters with a paranormal training program.I think it was as far away from Detroit as she could physically be.We stopped being so close after that. I kept my silver dagger in a shoebox under my bed, with the fucked up photos of the black hole Dad sent me every year I missed the road trip. I dated a guy in Shurley High\u2019s Friends of Possession society. I stayed out late talking to firefighters. She cried when I told her that I was going to Michigan State. I didn\u2019t tell her I was planning to major in Paranormal Studies until I was safe two thousand miles away.At the end of my sophomore year, I made it out to Detroit for the first time in six years for what the kids are calling Independence Day. I drove myself there for the first time, too, in the ratty \u201806 Chevy Camaro Mom helped me pay for once she was done having a nervous breakdown over my lifestyle choices. The big wire fence had been taken down years ago, when it became clear that the black hole wasn\u2019t a mark of evil and wasn\u2019t even all that black anymore. There are picnic benches and ice-cream trucks on the outer edges of the circle, where there are still ruins of what Detroit used to be. Farthest from the blast are a whole row of houses still intact, with guided tours for $10 and in the summer \u2013 on days like May 2 \u2013 an onsite artist offering sketches of you with real ol\u2019 fashioned pre-change houses for the small sum of $20. Dad and I had never bothered with any of that. All we ever needed was our cameras and each other. That year was like our special reunion tour. He showed me how the scar a class four poltergeist gave him over Easter was healing up just fine. I told him all about the paper I was writing on the properties of iron.I remember crossing over the line where the fence had been \u2013 there\u2019s just a plaque now, and a stripe in the grass where they used to lay the salt \u2013 I got this incredible feeling of warmth, like holding onto the wire thirteen years ago.Mom always said that one of the biggest surprises of everything that\u2019s happened since the changes was what happened to Detroit. She still says it sometimes, now she\u2019s beginning to forgive the place for breaking up her marriage. After the Great Quake and the Winchesters and the stories of Lucifer melting away into the air like dust, everyone figured the place for a lost cause. My kindergarten teacher told us that Sammy and Dean had put the black mark there so all the angels, locked back up in heaven, would never forget how naughty they had been. Uncle Jack just said that some things leave a mark. He said that this was one of them.Then right in the centre of the hole, where Sam Winchester had stood and said \u2018yes\u2019 and then \u2018no\u2019, water started dribbling out of a crack in the ground. There were no pictures \u2013 there will never be any pictures \u2013 and it took two months before anyone would even believe the helicopter crew who said they\u2019d seen it, said they\u2019d seen a river beginning to form. The only reason anyone ever believed them at all was because two months later saplings started to grow. And then trees began to shoot up, unnaturally fast - but what had ever been natural since the change? And the grass spread, and flowers spread with it, spiralling out and out from the centre of the hole, all the way up to where the fence stood. On May 2 2016, Chuck Shurley went into Detroit with a salt-gun and a book of exorcisms. Dad and I were watching with the usual crowd of pilgrims, and two hours later we were still watching when he came back out and said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing. I couldn\u2019t find anything.\u201dI remember people were cheering and crying. It became one of those things. Where were you when the Winchesters died? Where were you when Chuck Shurley came out of Detroit and said that it was clean?I was on my hands and knees, picking flowers through the gaps in the warm wire. My dad was helping the Paranorml Unit pull the Danger signs off of the fence. Not too long after that, Chuck Shurley became Secretary of Paranormal Defence in a voting landslide.Nine years later, the place was even more beautiful than it had been the day the fence came down. Animals were still pretty scarce \u2013 there were whole sections of the hole cordoned off from the public to encourage wildlife \u2013 but there were birds. Birds like you would not believe. I think you could spend your whole life studying the species that are changed and the species that are entirely new and you\u2019d probably only be half finished by the time you kicked the salt. Uncle Jack tells me pre-schoolers are getting a new story: Castiel put the birds there, and Anna gave them their feathers, and Gabriel gave them their voice. I\u2019m not superstitious, but something like that I could almost believe.Dad and I used to linger on the edges of the hole, taking pictures for his photo frames and my shoebox, but this was our first time since Mom had taken me down to California and we just dove right in. The further we went, the quieter it got, until eventually it was just the two of us and the silver gravel footpath meandering slowly down and down into the hole. The centre is as far as you can go. The footpath stops there, with a circular patch of gravel in the middle of the clearing for groups to stand and stare before they go back for their $20 sketches and genuine Detroit-style hot dogs. On May 2 2025, the clearing was filled with tiny silvery flowers, like forget-me-nots. They trailed all the way down to the banks of the Winchester River, bubbling so impossibly upstream. On the edge of the circle of gravel, there was a small and polite sign reminding us to please keep off the grass.Dad looked at the sign. Then he looked down at his camera. Then he looked up at me and he raised an eyebrow.\u201cHey, Gracie,\u201d he said. \u201cGo stand over by the river.\u201dI didn\u2019t need telling twice. The river was only seven, eight feet tops, away from where the footpath ended, but I took it slow, savouring each step. I\u2019d swear all those little flowers parted before my feet, because not one petal was damaged or bent out of shape when I reached the riverbank. I turned back to my dad, ready with the usual cheesy grin and cheesier thumbs-up which I knew would never make it into print.\u201cWould you look at that,\u201d Dad said. \u201cMy girl in the middle of Detroit.\u201dI laughed at that \u2013 in that way you do when a parent says something that isn\u2019t really all that funny, but you\u2019re just happy to be with them, and I was so damn happy right then \u2013 and my breath came out in a cold, white puff. \u201cShit,\u201d I said, and then my teeth started chattering too.Dad had dropped his camera and he was reaching for the silver knife he keeps on his belt, and I knew \u2013 even standing there, I knew I should have been reaching for the salt capsules I always carry in my pockets. But something stopped me. I don\u2019t know what, except maybe that my hands \u2013 still clutching at my own camera \u2013 felt as strangely warm as they had when I first grabbed onto the wire fence, May 2 2012.And then the ghost stepped out into the clearing.Even frozen in confusion as I was, I could tell right away it was a class two \u2013 unaware of its surroundings, still trapped in the time before its death, not malevolent but not necessarily harmless. How many people must have died in this city, I thought.It took me a little while longer to realise it was Sam Winchester.\u201cShit,\u201d I said again.Dad\u2019s hand stilled where it was grasping for his knife.Sam Winchester walked across the clearing, the silvery forget-me-nots shivering beneath his feet. He was taller than I\u2019d imagined. Gentler, too. He didn\u2019t look angry, or scared, or even ready for a battle \u2013 or anything you might expect for a guy about to face down Lucifer. He looked a little sad, I guess. Just a little sad.Sam stood in the middle of the clearing, tilting his head back like he was admiring the beautiful day, and then a sudden chill spread down my side and Dean Winchester brushed past me, leaving goosebumps in his wake. I wasn\u2019t at all surprised. It seemed obvious, really.Dean stopped about a foot away from Sam. Even now, some people still think that ghosts can\u2019t speak. They can, if they want to. But I guess the Winchesters didn\u2019t want to. They just stood and looked at each other, like they were the only two things in the world. Sam reached for his brother\u2019s hand.\u201cGracie,\u201d Dad whispered.So I lifted my camera and took a picture. Dean clapped his hand on Sam\u2019s shoulder and then scrubbed it through Sam\u2019s hair. Sam was grinning at him. For a second, they both flickered out of existence and I started forwards, reaching out as if I could pull them back somehow, but then they there were again, their foreheads tipped together.I remember thinking so clearly They died for this place. They thought we were all worth dying for and then they disappeared for good.The flowers settled gently back into place.\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be,\u201d Dad said. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be.\u201dHe picked up his camera and rubbed a hand across his face and for a little while we both just stood there, staring at the spot where the Winchesters had been. Then we walked back up the footpath and left Detroit behind. We never saw the Winchesters again. As far as I know, nobody has. But we still go every year, every May 2, and we stand in the centre, listening to the birds sing. I keep the photograph of that day in a frame on my bedside table. It\u2019s the usual greyish, greenish, distorted blur, but if you look really close there\u2019s this dark shape in the middle. It looks like two figures standing there together, merging into one.I hear the kids have a new name for Detroit.They\u2019re calling it Eden now.* Page 1 of 3<<[1] [2] [3] >> (70 comments) - (Post a new comment) macbyrne 2009-12-02 11:32 pm UTC (link) Oh my God.

The more time and effort you dedicate for a usable and nice-looking design, the higher are your chances for getting better account balance in the end of the month. So how can you make sure your portfolio is better than the portfolios of your competitors? How can you point employer\u2019s attention to your works?Creating a successful portfolio is easier than you think. Focus on simplicity, ease of use, hitting your objectives, professionally managing the project, and you\u2019ll end up with a successful portfolio. In this article we\u2019ll review 5 pitfalls that commonly plague portfolio design. Then we\u2019ll cover Portfolio Tips that if carefully considered and well executed will deliver quality results for your portfolio.There are some common mistakes designers make in their portfolios. Let\u2019s review these common pitfalls first to make sure you don\u2019t fall into one of these traps.Pitfall #1: ObfuscationClarity and focus should permeate your portfolio. With language don\u2019t use twenty words when seven will do. Push your best content to the front. When possible place your important content above the fold. Avoid meandering in your language or paths in your website. Keep your portfolio to the minimum of levels deep, while still accomplishing your goals.Over at Copyblogger there is an article that covers a simple list of writing tips from the man known for cutting out the fluff from writing in the early twentieth century. See the article Ernest Hemingway\u2019s Top 5 Tips for Writing Well. Hemingway championed using short sentences, strong forceful language, and clarity. All principles that make for effective writing on the Web. The Portfolio of Evan Eckard is an example of a website that promotes the work from the first page and Gets to it quickly.In the article Creating The Perfect Portfolio author Collis Ta\u2019eed offers portfolio advice from the perspective of a potential employer. One of his section titled Get to it on the reasons to limit the number of portfolio pieces you have and make finding your best portfolio pieces easy. A potential employer needs to review many potential applicants quickly. You are more likely to make the cut if your best work is promoted prominently. The Portfolio of Evan Eckard is an example of a website that promotes the work from the first page and Gets to it quickly.Pitfall #2: Information CrammingThere is an issue of wanting to say too much in too little space when creating your portfolio. There is a balance that needs to be achieved with how many pages deep you have users clicking for more information and how much information you try to fit on a page. This is an issue to be aware of when constructing your portfolio.The tighter you pack your portfolio the more likely it will appear cluttered. If you do need to put a large amount of information on a page see the post Grid and Column Designs over at Web Designer\u2019s wall. It will give you some great ideas on how you can use the grid to your advantage when presenting a vast amount of information. This article will give you some great ideas on how you can use the grid to your advantage when presenting a vast amount of information.Pitfall #3: Overdoing ItYou\u2019re less likely to go wrong if you keep things simple and organized. You can apply this mindset to all areas of your portfolio. Less is more. The more you try to do in your portfolio the more chances there are for things to go wrong.If you\u2019re trying to showcase eighteen services you offer you\u2019ll have less success than promoting a few prominently. If you show too many types of work or try to show too much work of any type than you\u2019ll likely to drown the user. They won\u2019t find your prominent pieces that show how great your work is.Pitfall #4: Uncommon NavigationDesigners have an urge to stand out as unique. The last place to follow this urge is in your site\u2019s navigation. It\u2019s a matter of numbers. If a large number of people coming to see your portfolio will have difficulty navigating through it, your portfolio will fail to meet its goals.On the blog Astheria in the post My Last Portfolio Sucked, Yours Might Too the author points out some excellent examples of navigation choices to avoid. In this article Kyle Meyer reviews 200 portfolios and points out the problems with using them. Navigation problems made up over 32 percent of the issues encountered. This article presents some excellent examples of navigation choices to avoid.Pitfall #5: Visual ClutterConsider the purpose of any decorative element you bring to your portfolio. If they fit your goals and compliment your work that\u2019s great. Otherwise remove them. White space helps to give a professional feel to your portfolio. The more visual elements you try to push into an area the more difficult it will be to maintain a feeling of professionalism.Consider visual hierarchy as a way to lead your viewing through the page. At Boxes and Arrows the article Visible Narratives: Understanding Visual Organization explains the principles of visual Hierarchies.In the interview Where Visual Design Meets Usability \u2013 An Interview with Luke Wroblewski, Part II both page hierarchy and visual clutter are addressed. In the article he summarizes some of Edward Tufte\u2019s teachings on avoiding superfluous data.12 Principles of Effective Portfolio DesignBelow you\u2019ll find 12 suggestions which you can use to improve your portfolio or get it right first time when designing from scratch. Please keep in mind that some of these suggestions require patience, time and quite a lot of planning. However, it\u2019s worth it. And the examples provided below show that one can achieve outstanding results with just following these 12 simple rules.1. Define your Criteria and Strategies for SuccessAs with any project it will help you to clarify your goals before you begin. Once you know your goals then it will effect every decision you make about creating your portfolio.Below are some common portfolio goals. Also, be aware that often portfolios try to accomplish more than one goal. Or, consider creating more than one portfolio that serves a different purpose.The Hire Me Portfolio focuses on getting you a job. If you are actively searching for a job then the current goal of your portfolio is to get hired. In this type of portfolio you can target the work you show to the type of company you want to work for.The Sales Generation Portfolio focuses on keeping a flow of work always coming in the door. The goal here is to generate leads. And move potential customers through your sales channel.The Reputation Building Portfolio focuses on building your name in the industry and online. This may take the form of an artist\u2019s showcase. Or tie your work together with a blog on your portfolio site.The Networking Portfolio focuses on building relationships. There are many networks that have excellent portfolio building tools. They have some advantages to placing your portfolio on their website. Chiefly among them is to leverage the site space for networking.2. Consider Using Multiple PortfoliosThere are multiple reasons to have more than one portfolio. You may have more than one skill set that you would like to promote separately. You may want to create a portfolio that is targeted to landing a specific job and send it to a marketing director at a company. They\u2019ll appreciate that. It saves them time and shows you really want the job. Even if its a one page portfolio.Even if you are filling the portfolio with the same work you will still benefit by having multiple portfolios within different groups online. Take the case of Nik Ainley, a UK-based designer and illustrator. He has multiple portfolios that all serve complimentary goals. He chose to participate in multiple portfolio-based communities to build his reputation and network with other designers. His website Shiny Binary has received over 1 million visitors.He has a Portfolio on Behance. He\u2019s involved in numerous groups there and has a large Inner Circle. And it prominently displays that he is available for Freelancing, Long-Term Contract, Full-Time Hire, or Consulting work.Nick has a very popular Portfolio on DeviantArt. He\u2019s been a member there since 2004. He has over 80 Portfolio pieces and over 1,000 comments on his work there. He has a lot of fans that have his works marked as favorites.He is less active though he does have a Gallery on CPLUV. His Portfolio on Depthcore is really good. This site features artists that have to be invited to contribute. So, the quality of work on this site is really high.Overall Nik Ainley shows how you can benefit from having multiple portfolios online even when the work you are showcasing is similar in each portfolio. That is because you are taping into a different community with each portfolio you create. You\u2019re meeting people, exposing them to your work, and making new connections by placing your portfolio within different communities.Some portfolio communities to look at:Behance NetworkCoroflot PortfoliosDeviant ArtCPULuvFlickr3. Target Your MarketThe more you target your design to a specific market the more it will speak to the visitor within that market. If you are looking to land corporate clients in a conservative industry than present them with work that is clean, marketable, and looks successful. Don\u2019t showcase edgy, grungy, or arty work unless that\u2019s the market you\u2019re going after.In the article The Secret to Getting a Lot of Web Design Work the author has a section \u201cDesign the portfolio you think your clients want to see\u201d. This is the point. Make your portfolio focused on your target market. If you\u2019re trying to get clients then design keeping these clients in mind.There are more benefits outlined to targeting a specific market. In the article Finding a Target Market the author Barbara Pellow discusses both Vertical and Horizontal Approaches to target marketing. She identifies some of the additional benefits of target marketing. Speaking to a specific audience allows you to become a recognized expert in the field easier. Targeting your market can differentiate your services.Consider this example: a web designer that specializes in designer Law Firm websites has a different target market than a company that builds Rock Band websites. The language, graphics, and approach sch portfolios take will differ greatly. If a web designer has numerous successful Law Firm websites in their portfolio it will make it easier for a potential law firm client to choose them over another designer or design agency.A designer is more likely to stand out by targeting a specific market. Their success rate at landing jobs in a specific niche and being perceived as an expert in that area will increase. Take a look at the Dan Gilroy Design Portfolio for an example of a website that successfully targets a specific market.Having a target market in mind is essential to choosing your portfolio pieces and your approach to designing your website.4. Make Usability a Top PriorityNavigation is a top consideration as a user being able to view your portfolio is of paramount importance. See the point about Uncommon Navigation above. Some other considerations are using web standards. This is especially true if you\u2019re looking for a job as a web designer today. Read this article Five steps to a better design portfolio by Jefferey Veen. In it he discusses some issues around best practices in your portfolio in relation to how you will be perceived by a potential employer.Also, don\u2019t discount the search bots. Work toward better Search Engine Optimization. The blog at SEOBook is a rich resource on this topic. Good SEO will improve the ability for potential clients to find you through the major search engines.5. Utilize the Right TechnologyIf there are technologies inherent in your job description then it may make sense to build your portfolio with that technology. Sure Flash is cool, but is it right for your website. Probably not if you\u2019re a logo designer. Though if you\u2019re trying to land a job as a Flash Designer at a top notch Interactive Design Agency like Story Worldwide than its the right choice.The New Media Designer Portfolio of Mathew V. Robinson presents an easy to use navigation. Essential to the success of a Flash site, it\u2019s fast loading. His portfolio is highly usable and looks great.Consider maintainability when deciding on technologies. Simplifying your portfolio as much as possible will ease the time you\u2019ll have to spend on upgrading or making changes to the website. You should consider how easy it is to add and remove portfolio pieces.The easier it is the more likely it is you\u2019ll update your portfolio on a regular basis. Jamie Gregory has an simple, elegant, and effective one page portfolio. He would have no trouble adding or swapping out pieces from this portfolio.Consider enhancement when looking at technology. Often a wise choice is to add a little Javascript or other technologies rather than rely on them. It can help you to achieve your goals without overly complicating your portfolio design. When visiting Marius Roosendaal\u2019s Portfolio take a moment to explore how clean the source code is. This is done while providing elegant Javascript-based solutions.Choose between creating a static site or utilizing a CMS (Content Management System). One page portfolios are really easy to update and a good way to quickly show your best work. You\u2019ll also have no issues with navigation, as there is only one page. Though there is little flexibility there and you\u2019re not leveraging some additional features that content management systems have for promoting your work, like having a blog.6. Plan Your Portfolio ProjectOne of the key ingredients to creating a successful portfolio is to approach it like you would a client project. Manage this project as professionally as you would any other web project you take on. Set aside the time needed to achieve the goals you\u2019ve outlined for the portfolio. Make sure you set up deadlines so that you have key targets to hit.7. Narrow the Scope and Type of Work PromotedYour portfolio should be limited to the best work you will promote within the scope of your goals. If you are taking on website redesigns then your portfolio should consist only of that, not logo designs or print work that you\u2019ve done. If its not the work you\u2019re targeting than don\u2019t include it. You will be more successful.Jesse Bennett-Chamberlain redesigned his website 31three.com back in May of 2007. Before doing so he used to have print and logo designs in his portfolio. In the redesign he clarified his target market by focusing on assisting developers with design. His current portfolio only presents website and interface designs he has created because that is the type of work he is looking for. This portfolio is very successful on many points and has been referenced in many articles throughout the blogosphere.That doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t do logo or identity design. He does do that, but he\u2019s recognized that logo design is not why people come to him. They come to him for website designs for new or existing sites and logo design may be a part of the package. See more about his process at this article Redesigning the ExpressionEngine Site.Certainly some designers or firms will have mixed bag portfolios. The more types of work you do successfully the greater challenge you\u2019ll have in promoting that work. When possible keep the work on display to a minimum. Displaying 10 of your best pieces of work is often better than displaying 50 good pieces.8. Provide Adequate Contact Information, Documentation, and ExplanationsContact information should be easy to find and in the case of contact forms they should be easy to use. Prominently place this kind of information. The Hicksdesign Portfolio has contact information displayed well on every page.It helps to build confidence with your target market to clarify your role in the projects you present in your portfolio. If you designed the website, but someone else coded it, then state that. If you did everything then confidently declare that as well.The Portfolio of Cameron Moll employs this strategy on each portfolio piece.Providing case studies gives a deeper view into your process. Once a potential employer or client has narrowed down their list they may come back and start to take more time with your portfolio. Case studies will show how competent and thorough your process is. David Airey does a good job of providing easy to find case studies on his portfolio pieces.Client testimonials are effective for persuading those that visit your site that you will deliver on your promises. It increases the level of professionalism when tastefully incorporating testimonial into your portfolio. David Airey has an article titled The Importance of Client Testimonials that has useful information on this subject.9. Present Your Work Within the Confines of Your GoalsYour work needs to stand out foremost in your portfolio. If your portfolio site design overpowers the work on display then you\u2019re not likely to meet your site goals. Consider carefully every visual element you add to the design. When unsure shoot for simplicity.10. Infuse Your Personality Into Your DesignNick La has a portfolio design that shows his design style and interests. The unique background illustration stands out. It doesn\u2019t interfere with the usability of the site, but it gives it a beautiful wrapper. For some this would be to much and interfere with the work being presented. Though the work presented in his portfolio works fine. He sets the portfolio pieces against a solid white background in a strong column-based design. The work presented fits with the style of the sites background illustration. Pulling off this kind of personal infusion into the design of your site is difficult to achieve.Doing this well makes your portfolio not only memorable but remarkable! Nick La achieved tremendous success with his portfolio for N.design Studio. Being remarkable in the design of your portfolio often means bringing to fruition the personal design taste unique to you that has been cultivated over the years.Seth Goden has some excellent points about being remarkable in his post How to be remarkable. Here is a quote from the post \u201cRemarkability lies in the edges. The biggest, fastest, slowest, richest, easiest, most difficult.\u201d This is a good point, but there is a huge risk involved in that pursuing the remarkable edge you ride right off the cliff.Carefully consider how you will blend your remarkable personal elements into your portfolio without sacrificing usability and without misaligning the balance between the prominence of your portfolio and the design of the site itself.11. Promote and Leverage Your WorkThere are many techniques for promoting your portfolio. Consider joining professional online communities and networking with other community members. We\u2019ve already looked at some communities that you can place a portfolio on. Place a thread in a design forum about your portfolio. Submit your design to gallery websites. Almost any technique that can be used to promote a website can be used to promote your portfolio.Add a blog to your website. The more traffic you can pull to your website the more exposure your portfolio will receive. Dan Cederholm was an early adopter of this technique and achieved fame with his blog Simplebits. His portfolio resides successfully on the same site.Leveraging your work involves linking to it when you send emails. Include a link to your portfolio site in your Facebook profile or any other community you belong to. Infuse your portfolio site within your communications and your online identity.12. Develop Your Long-Term Portfolio GoalsIt always helps to have a view toward the future. Your portfolio needs are likely to change many times as you develop different projects over the course of your career. Though even looking at the whole of 2008 and not only at the next week can make a big difference in the choices you make when creating your portfolio.Putting it all together: a successful portfolio finds that perfect blend of your personality, prominence of work, simplicity, and ease of use that makes your portfolio stand out from the crowd and achieve your goals.Tweet Sean HodgeSean Hodge is the creative mind behind AiBURN, a weblog about design, creativity, inspiration and graphics.HomepageTwitter PageTags: portfolios, principlesBookmarkVote upRetweetShare Advertising100 CommentsBest Comments 10 Jerome Gravel-Niquet March 4th, 2008 11:04 amIf you actually want to make usability the top priority, then there goes any fancy way of displaying information.Usability relies on commonly used and familiar elements on web pages. Yet, in my opinion, portfolio should look fancy.I\u2019m not saying usability should be completely ignored, but you can certainly experiment and try it yourself or make a friend try it real quick just to see if your website is truly intuitive to use or not. Reply 20 jani anderson February 1st, 2011 11:30 amI agree. A little bit of experimentation is how we develop new standards. Reply 30 Fran March 4th, 2008 11:19 amSorry, but if I\u00b4m a client and I don\u00b4t undertand your experimental portfolio, you don\u00b4t work for me. Really, I\u00b4m interaction design specialist and when we have looking for a web designer and see his portfolios, the first thing than I do, is looking theirs diferents works, for diferents clients, no only style.Believe me, follow the steps of this article.PD: sorry for my english.

Reply 90 imaginepaolo March 4th, 2008 11:56 amReally good, great collection of portoflio tecniques.. . Reply 100 Reginald March 4th, 2008 12:35 pmI read your post, and I think I get the bottom line of your article.You have certainly addressed some fundamentals for online businesses and writing in general that any individual can put to practical use.What I would have hoped that you would expand upon is the focused definition of portfolio, especially with regards to the context you associated it with in your post.

I like this post.. digg it \u2026 next Reply 120 Lindsey March 4th, 2008 1:34 pm@MikeMaybe you should hire a designer to do the graphic elements and layout . Ad a developer you probably shouldn\u2019t have anything over the top. Just something clean and elegant that shows off your coding accomplishments. Communicate to them how your coding or your projects are innovative and a good designer can communicate that through design. Reply 130 Kyle Meyer March 4th, 2008 1:44 pmThanks for including my article. : ) Reply 140 Evan Meagher March 4th, 2008 1:54 pmGreat tips, regardless of industry. Love the example sites.

Reply 16+1 Matt Radel March 4th, 2008 2:59 pmGreat tips \u2013 thanks. Now I just need to get around to actually creating my portfolio site\u2026 Reply 170 Wojtek S. March 4th, 2008 3:32 pmGreat article as always, thank you Smashing Magazine! Reply 18+1 Kristian March 4th, 2008 3:47 pmI agree that usability has to be the top priority. I beleive that a porfolio page is one of the most critical pages on any website. The portfolio link is what a reader clicks on after they like what they see on your home page. I beleive that if the user didn\u2019t like what they saw on the home page they would not have gone to the portfolio page at all. So I think that if a user is at your portfolio page there is no need to be doing any showing off. The showing off all happened on the home page, and it worked. Now its a time where I would like to get serious and tell my clients how I have helped other people. I like to see the portfolio as a page where I build trust with my potential clients. If they are at my portfolio they already like my skill level. If I can just build enough trust I am on the way to landing a client. I think that building trust with your client isn\u2019t a time to be using gimics, fancy navigations and other novelties. I like to just give them the information that they want to see. In a very straight forward manner. Reply 190 Braintrove.com March 4th, 2008 4:14 pmVery nice list. Very useful information. Thank you. Reply 200 Benjamin David March 4th, 2008 4:46 pmGreat article, as usual ! Thank you ! Reply 210 John Faulds March 4th, 2008 7:17 pmAnother tip for success? Using good grammar. Reading this article made me cringe.I\u2019ll admit to being a bit of a grammar nazi, but I think a bit of leeway should be given when the authors\u2019 original language isn\u2019t English. Reply 220 Alex March 4th, 2008 7:34 pmOh perfect, i was creating an online portfolio just now! Thanks! Reply 230 Eric Kelsey March 4th, 2008 8:49 pmIf your goal is to get hired by a company, you shouldn\u2019t make your portfolio look like it is a business. This is one of the biggest mistakes I see from designers who are seeking employment. I wish they would have included that in this article. Reply 240 Eric March 4th, 2008 8:56 pmI agree 100 percent! No matter how good your site is, bad spelling and grammar make a person look unintelligent.Spelling and grammar are especially important when dealing with print design. Proof reading is part of the job and mistakes can be expensive. Reply 25-1 Polly December 10th, 2009 3:22 amSpelling is important. You\u2019ve spelled Nik two ways (Nik and Nick) and it undermines your otherwise good advice. You could use a sharp-eyed proofreader. Why not email me?

Reply 420 Ginger March 6th, 2008 2:36 amUsability as your top criteria for designing your portfolio sit is THE WORST mistake you can make. People should find easy their way to navigate the site, no doubt of that, but if you try to attract people the worst you can do is be part of the crowd. If you take a look at some of the most successful web studios you will see they are doing more visual appealing sites instead of \u201cdo it simple\u201d. Making a simple portfolio design and you will get simple clients with simple ideas. That\u2019s a little bit exaggerated but you get my point.Actually Jerome Gravel-Niquet was right about it. If you want people to notice you that be creative. Since most of the people just follow steps in online tutorials you have the best chance to get ahead of them:-) Reply 430 Shane March 6th, 2008 5:37 amAn interesting article \u2013 usability needn\u2019t kill how interesting something is; we should always keep usability in mind.Sure, a Portfolio should be interesting, but not at the expense of a user\u2019s goals and objectives. Reply 440 Kelly Shaw March 6th, 2008 2:02 pmGreat Article, I\u2019ll be sharing this with our team here.Points 8 and 9 cannot be over emphasized. I regard a portfolio as a collection of stories about problems and solutions. The case study approach shows both creative and business acumen. Revealing role in these stories is also essential as it shows prospective employers what you\u2019re ready for.Portfolios are great at affirming tacit knowledge, in turn boosting confidence in developed skills. Reply 450 Richard March 6th, 2008 7:23 pmGood ideas, but painful to read. I agree with John Faulds @23 about the cringe factor. If language is not a strength of yours, then keep the writing on your site to a minimum. You will be judged by your attention to detail in your writing as well as your designs. And if you\u2019re writing an article, please at least learn the differences between \u201cyour\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re\u201d, \u201cthen\u201d and \u201cthan\u201d and \u201cits\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s\u201d.

Reply 860 Peter Stanbury February 11th, 2010 8:42 amThanks for this very helpful article. One spends so much time thinking about what the client wants, and what the client will find appealing, when you come to create a showcase of your work it can seem baffling what to do. I can only say let the work speak for itself. Show the work you want to do. Not the work you would do for the money and only if you had to. A creative must work from the inside out and do what has meaning. I have always thought that being a graphic designer risks ending up doing what others want at the expense of personal meaning. The signature of self is everything. Great work arises out of that. Reply 870 Will Jones February 26th, 2010 9:47 amVery nice and detailed blog post.

The available tools and services available today make the realization of good portfolio\u2019s so much easier. I totally agree with going for multiple portfolio\u2019s. It\u2019s important as a professional to have your own portfolio site on your own domain (your base) and use portfolio and networking sites like Behance, Flickr, etc.. to expand your reach. This all works complementary. Graham took this a bit over the top;) http://imjustcreative.com/21-creative-online-portfolio-sites-and-applications/2010/02/08/Regarding building your portfolio site all yourself or use online tools and services, I guess if your don\u2019t have the skills to code and don\u2019t have much budget and time to let others do it for you (like most freelances have) use these tools and services to lighten and speed up the process. The last years we\u2019ve been working on the creation of a hosted portfolio tool that gives you freedom to realize your own design idea\u2019s and makes it easy to put it together.

However, it\u2019s perfectly possible to have an attractive/interesting/creative design whilst maintaining usability and accessibility. You just need to think outside of the box when it comes to design. Anyone who tells me that you can\u2019t have a fabulous-looking portfolio and still maintain usability and accessibility is not being very creative.[The reason why I threw in accessibility is because by law (in the UK anyway), if you're providing a service online then your website needs to be accessible. Plus, I have a hearing impairment and I understand the need for accessibility, not just for hearing impairment but also for other types of impairments.] Reply 980 David November 17th, 2010 7:11 pmAs a person with technical web programming skills building This1That1Whatever.com/ but not much web design skills, I find pages like this to be so useful and inspiring.

Now I just need to get around to actually creating my portfolio site\u2026 3+1 Kristian March 4th, 2008 3:47 pmI agree that usability has to be the top priority. I beleive that a porfolio page is one of the most critical pages on any website. The portfolio link is what a reader clicks on after they like what they see on your home page. I beleive that if the user didn\u2019t like what they saw on the home page they would not have gone to the portfolio page at all. So I think that if a user is at your portfolio page there is no need to be doing any showing off. The showing off all happened on the home page, and it worked. Now its a time where I would like to get serious and tell my clients how I have helped other people. I like to see the portfolio as a page where I build trust with my potential clients. If they are at my portfolio they already like my skill level. If I can just build enough trust I am on the way to landing a client. I think that building trust with your client isn\u2019t a time to be using gimics, fancy navigations and other novelties. I like to just give them the information that they want to see.

Antiquated methods of teaching history do not equip today\u2019s students to think critically about the past, the present or the future. Library and Archives Canada The Benchmarks Idea What should students know after 12 years of studying history in school? What should they be able to do with their knowledge? Surely they should have more than an accumulation of memorized facts to show for years of study. The Benchmarks Project combines the research of historians and educators with the experience and skills of classroom teachers to create practical ways of encouraging promoting and assessing students\u2019 historical thinking in classroom settings. Benchmarks defines historical thinking by identifying its key components (the historical thinking concepts that appear in the right column on this page). The project provides teaching tasks which that promote historical thinking through the development of those concepts, and publishes tools to assess students\u2019 ability to demonstrate historical thinking. In so doing, Benchmarks also aims to provide social studies departments, local boards, provincial ministries of education, publishers and public history agencies with models of more meaningful history assessment teaching and learning for their students and audiences.

A surveyor cut a \"benchmark\" into a stone or a wall when measuring the altitude and/or level of a tract of land. A\u00a0bracket called a \"bench\" was secured in the cut to mount the surveying equipment, and all subsequent measurements\u00a0were made in reference to the position and height of that mark. The term \"benchmark\" was first used around 1842 to refer to a standard of quality by which achievement may be\u00a0measured. The foundation documents available through the Benchmarks site attempt to help teachers establish standards for\u00a0assessing student learning of the modes of thought that constitute historical thinking.

Advertising Blog","tags":["twitter","influence","duncan_watts","ses","reading","watts","social"],"body":" skip to navigation March 23rd, 2011 10:10 AM How to Measure Twitter Influence Yahoo!\u2019s Duncan Watts brings science to social media at SES The careful student of the Yahoo! Advertising Blog knows that Duncan Watts of Yahoo! Labs has brought actual science to social media. Most importantly, he proved what you always knew: that most of your tweets go exactly nowhere. Yesterday in his keynote at the Seach Engine Strategies conference in New York, Duncan revisited that theme, but with some refined science and a little more generosity\u2014only 90% of your tweets don\u2019t go anywhere, instead of the 99% once believed. (The good news, I guess, is that you only have to try to make 10% of your tweets any good.) Duncan described his Twitter Influence Project, which measured millions of tweets and found that that the only things that affected a tweet\u2019s ability to go viral is the number of followers, and whether or not the person has had a viral tweet before. Content and volume of tweets don\u2019t matter as much as you think. Most importantly, Duncan said, his work showed that almost anyone can influence someone else, and that it\u2019s tough to predict who those people will be. \u201cThere are no special people out there who you can tap into to change the world out there on your behalf,\u201d he said. To see this tied up all neatly, check out Duncan\u2019s new book, Everything Is Obvious (Once You Know the Answer. And to see the book tied up even more neatly, watch the video below. \u2014 Jeff Sweat, Editor-in-Chief Related Posts \u201cTrending Now\u201d Drives User Engagement5 Questions for Optimedia\u2019s Antony YoungFree adCenter Desktop Webinar March 2919 Tools for Competitive ResearchMobile Retail Revolution Posted by Administrator [ No comments | Categories: Events, Industry Trends, Insights, Yahoo!

Welcome to another issue of Spotlight \u2013 a weekly post where I\u2019ll be highlighting some of the articles and videos posted by the community lately which you might find beneficial.Before we get started, I\u2019d just like to remind everyone that jQuery 1.5 beta\u00a0is currently out and the team are hoping to finalize an RC in the next few days/week. If you have a chance to spend some time testing it out we would appreciate any feedback or bug reports. These always help the team ensure the release is as stable as possible. Look out for new features coming to the RC like the final version of Deferreds which we summarized here\u00a0(and which Rebecca Murphy discusses here)\u00a0as well as subclassing.On to this week\u2019s recommended reading and viewing!

Quite often with image galleries powered by jQuery, we\u2019re presented with a very similar layout \u2013 one which contains the images or items presented inside a rectangle. This is great for providing an experience users are used to, but there are a few interesting alternatives that you may like to hear about \u2013 how about displaying your images or items around a shape like a circle or an ellipse instead?. In today\u2019s post I\u2019ll be showing you how to do just that with a brand new plugin I\u2019ve written called jQuery Roundrr.

Today I\u2019d like to share something new with you \u2013 I call it jQuery FormBox. When designing the layout for a website there\u2019s one thing that we as designers are always conscious of \u2013 making things easier for users. No matter what it is your site offers, you\u2019re still going to need to balance the interface in a way that keeps it very easy for users to find and perform core site functions around your site or service, ideally without having to load up a completely different page.Some of these common functions are logging in, registering or even resetting a password, yet quite often in many cases we still provide users the same old experience \u2013 a separate page for logging in, another for signing-up and yet again another if you\u2019ve forgotten what your login details were. Today I would like to present a project that tries to streamline this experience \u2013 FormBox.\u00a0 Click here to read more \u00bb WanderWall \u2013 A jQuery, CSS3 & HTML5 Hover-Based InterfacePosted on August 22, 2010 in: Code Samples, Design|101873 Commentshttp%3A%2F%2Faddyosmani.com%2Fblog%2Fwanderwall%2FWanderWall+-+A+jQuery%2C+CSS3+%26+HTML5+Hover-Based+Interface2010-08-23+01%3A58%3A48Addyhttp%3A%2F%2Faddyosmani.com%2Fblog%2F%3Fp%3D1018\u00a0Hey guys. Today I\u2019m going to teach you how to create a useful hover-based user interface using jQuery, CSS3, HTML5 and @font-face. Why a hover-based interface? you might ask. Well, with the popularity of touch-based web applications simplifying the way that people can use sites on mobile devices, I think that there\u2019s room for us to look into ways of making it even easier for people to use sites in desktop-based browsers too. Today\u2019s project,WanderWall, achieves that and what we\u2019ll be creating today could easily be used for a portfolio or business site but the concepts you\u2019ll learn could certainly be used to expand the idea further.

Retailers such as Woodcraft Supply, BabyAge.com and HealthWarehouse.com implemented Google Commerce Search on their respective websites; Woodcraft increased search revenues 34 percent, BabyAge increased site searches 64 percent and HealthWarehouse saw online conversions increase 19 percent\u2014and all have reported an increase in customer satisfaction. Today we\u2019re building on the capabilities that have proved useful to our retail partners with the third-generation Google Commerce Search (GCS). With this new version, we hope to help create an even more interactive and engaging experience for shoppers and retailers. Here are some of the cool new features in GCS 3.0: Search as You Type provides instant gratification to shoppers, returning product results with every keystroke, right from the search bar Local Product Availability helps retailers bridge online and offline sales by showing shoppers when a product is also available in a store nearby\u2014in-line with the search results Enhanced Merchandising tools allow retailers to create product promotions that display in banners alongside related search queries, and to easily set query-based landing pages (for example, when a visitor types [shoes], they\u2019re directed to a \u201cshoe\u201d page) Product Recommendations (Labs) helps shoppers make purchase decisions by showing them what others viewed and ultimately bought Search As You Type on www.babyage.com With this release we're also welcoming three new retail partners: Forever21, General Nutrition Company (GNC) and L\u2019Occitane. GNC implemented Google Commerce Search in less than a week on their mobile website, while Forever 21 and L\u2019Occitane are currently working to implement various new features of GCS, such as Search as You Type and Local Product Availability. Here\u2019s what Christine Burke, VP of International E-Commerce at cosmetics staple L\u2019Occitane had to say about GCS 3.0: L\u2019Occitane is unique in that our beauty products center around ingredients\u2014such as lavender, shea butter and verbena. As our customers visit our re-designed website to shop and research our products, we\u2019re excited about the speed and accuracy of on-site search results that will be provided to us through Google Commerce Search. We\u2019re also very excited about the possibility of the new local inventory feature, which can help us connect our customers with their favorite products in one of our 170 U.S. boutiques.For more information, visit google.com/commercesearch.

During the three-and-a-half hour Grand Finale\u2014and as people in different timezones awoke to re-broadcasts\u2014the event was streamed 33 million times around the world to 189 countries. This included 2.8 million mobile live-streams\u2014making it one of our biggest ever streaming events to date, on mobile and desktop. That means the event was streamed to nearly one-and-a-half times the entire population of Australia, where the event took place. One of the goals of the YouTube Symphony Orchestra is to make classical music accessible; the total data transferred by the stream was a whopping 422 terabytes\u2014the equivalent of 145 million MP3 files of classical music being emailed around the world. The top 10 countries viewing the performance online were: 1. U.S. 2. Germany 3. Italy 4. France 5. Poland 6. Russia 7. Australia 8. U.K. 9. Brazil 10. Taiwan Enormous thanks go to all our Symphony members who flew to Sydney from around the world and put their hearts and souls into an extraordinary performance. You surprised and moved people and had some fun along the way! For the rest of you, you can read about the experience of YouTube Symphony Orchestra 2011 cellist Mathisha Panagoda in a guest post on the YouTube Australia blog. And if you missed the Grand Finale, you can watch the full concert and highlights from the last week anytime at youtube.com/symphony. Posted by Ed Sanders, Group Marketing Manager Permalink Links to this post Share: Tweet Labels: video This week in search 3/25/11 3/25/2011 04:47:00 PM This is part of a regular series of posts on search experience updates that runs on Fridays. Look for the label \"This week in search\" and subscribe to the series. - Ed. Time is a precious commodity for most of us. To save you more precious seconds as you search, we\u2019ve introduced Google Instant in Places View and redesigned the Google Search app for iPhone for faster, easier searching\u2014whether you\u2019re on your way out or already on the go. Instant for Places View As part of our ongoing effort to give you the Instant experience everywhere on Google, this week we\u2019ve enabled Instant in Places View so you can find where you want to go even more quickly. To get to Places View, click \u201cPlaces\u201d in the left-hand panel; once you\u2019re there, any search you perform will have place and map results that update as you type. We\u2019ll continue to expand Instant to all views, languages and domains over the next few months. Google Search app for iPhone The redesigned Google Search app for iPhone, formerly known as Google Mobile App, improves the Google search experience on iOS mobile devices, giving you intuitive gesture controls. First, when browsing through search results or looking at a webpage, you can swipe down to see the search bar to type in a new query or change your settings. The redesigned home screen of Google Search app There\u2019s also a new toolbar that makes it easier for you to filter your results\u2014for example, if you only want to see images or shopping results. You can open this toolbar by swiping from left to right. The toolbar helps you filter your results Plus, now it\u2019s easier to pick up searching where you left off. If you leave the app and come back later, you\u2019ll be able to get back to exactly where you were by tapping on the lower part of the page. To use the Google Search app, download or update it in the iTunes App Store. Search in Cherokee (\u13e3\u13b3\u13a9) With translation help from the Cherokee Nation staff and community members, we\u2019ve added Cherokee (\u13e3\u13b3\u13a9) as an interface language on Google. You can set Cherokee as your default from the Language Tools page (available to the right of the search box). We\u2019ve also included an on-screen Cherokee keyboard\u2014which you can access by clicking the icon at the right side of the search box\u2014for people who don\u2019t have a physical Cherokee keyboard.

Look for the label \u201cGoogle Apps highlights\" and subscribe to the series. - Ed. We\u2019ve been busy over the last few weeks adding better discussion tools to Google Docs, improving collaboration within traditional productivity software and making it faster and easier to work with information in your email inbox. Google Apps administrators can also now view detailed information about how their users are being more productive with our collaboration tools, and control how quickly new features are released to their organizations. Better discussions in Google documents Productive discussions can help teams write better documents, and last Wednesday we introduced improvements to how you can converse about documents within Google Docs. Profile pictures and timestamps make it easy to see who made a comment and when, and you can direct a comment to someone using an @mention. You can follow discussions with notifications right in your inbox\u2014and even continue a discussion from your inbox by replying to the notification email. Instead of deleting a discussion when it\u2019s wrapped up to remove clutter, you can now mark discussions as resolved so you can go back later and see how the discussion played out. Data filtering, new chart options and more in Google spreadsheets We\u2019ve added a heap of frequently requested features to Google spreadsheets over the last few weeks. First, you can now filter spreadsheet data to hone in on rows that match criteria you set as filter options. For example, a sales manager could choose to view transactions processed by Peter and Phil, but not those managed by Andrew, Cindy and the rest of the sales team. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019ve also improved charting in spreadsheets by making it possible to plot non-contiguous data. Multiple chart ranges help you create great charts without rearranging your data. In addition, you can now hide cell gridlines or entire sheets in Google spreadsheets\u2014giving your spreadsheets a cleaner look by removing extraneous formatting and data from view until you need it at a later time. \u00a0\u00a0 Google Cloud Connect for Microsoft Office As we continue to add functionality to Google Docs, many people are finding that that they no longer need software-based word processing, spreadsheet and presentation software. And now we also have an alternative for people who want streamlined collaboration but aren\u2019t quite ready for 100% web productivity tools. Google Cloud Connect for Microsoft Office brings multi-person editing, automatic backup and complete revision history to Microsoft Word\u00ae, Excel\u00ae and PowerPoint\u00ae in Microsoft Office\u00ae 2003, 2007 and 2010. By bringing this functionality to existing versions of Microsoft Office, organizations can work more efficiently with the software that they\u2019ve already paid for and implemented. Smart Labels in Gmail Labs Chances are, you get lots of email from newsletters, group mailing lists, account alerts and other automated systems. These messages aren\u2019t spam, but they\u2019re probably not your most important emails either. To help you separate and organize these kinds of messages, we introduced the Smart Labels feature in Gmail Labs. Once you turn on this feature from the Labs tab in Gmail settings, Gmail will automatically categorize incoming Bulk, Forum and Notification messages and label them appropriately, removing clutter in your inbox to help your most important messages stand out. Improved attachment viewing in Gmail We\u2019ve also made viewing attachments in Gmail faster, easier, more affordable and more secure by adding browser-based attachment viewing for 12 more file types: .XLS, .XLSX, .PPTX, .PAGES, .AI, .PSD, .DXF, .SVG, .EPS, .PS, .TTF and .XPS. So instead of downloading attachments and then opening files with software you may or may not have for each format, you can just click the \u201cView\u201d link next to the attachment in Gmail. This will instantly display the attachment in your browser\u2014no software required. Collaboration dashboard for Google Apps customers To help customers see the productivity benefits of Google Apps at a glance, we recently introduced a new collaboration dashboard. From the Google Apps administrative control panel, IT managers can view insights about how their users are working together with Google Docs. This dashboard offers a new level of transparency that traditional software can\u2019t offer, and we think this kind of information will help businesses invest in technologies that actually get put to use, not software that\u2014according to customers\u2014sometimes sits idle after being installed. New Google Apps release process Our customers love Google Apps for lots of reasons, but the ability to rapidly get new features\u2014like the ones described in this post\u2014without having to install complex patches or upgrades rises to the top. Instead of large, disruptive batches of new features that only come every few years, people see a continuous stream of better functionality week after week. Still, some customers with more complex IT environments have asked for a bit more advanced notice so they can prepare for what\u2019s coming. For these organizations, we\u2019ve introduced a new release process for Google Apps features. Customers can choose to get new features immediately when they\u2019re available, or have at least a week to prepare for new features after they\u2019re initially introduced. Along with this new choice, we\u2019ve launched whatsnew.googleapps.com, where customers can learn more about new features in the process of being released. Who\u2019s gone Google? The pace of new customers coming onto Google Apps continues to accelerate among schools, businesses and other organizations. In the world of education, we\u2019re happy to welcome the University of Alberta, Anhanguera Educational and thousands of other schools to Google Apps. In fact, over 50 percent of the NCAA\u00ae Championship bracket has gone Google!

You can now select Cherokee as your default from the Language Tools page (available from the right of the search box), and the entire Google interface will transform into Cherokee: We\u2019ve also included an on-screen Cherokee keyboard on the search page through the Google Virtual Keyboard API. This makes it easier for people to search web content in Cherokee without a physical Cherokee keyboard. To access the keyboard, simply click the icon at the right side of the search box. Cherokee is an Iroquoian language spoken by the Cherokee people. The Cherokee syllabary writing system was developed by Sequoyah in the early 19th century. He realized the power of writing systems, and wanted his people to benefit from that power. Some of the 85 characters he developed for his syllabary were modified from his original handwritten script for a printing press in the 1820s, resulting in characters that resemble Latin and Greek letters. Despite the resemblance, they are pronounced differently. The modified script was quickly adapted for printing Cherokee newspapers, books and pamphlets. The adoption and use of the script enabled the Cherokee people to maintain their language and culture. Today, Cherokee is spoken mostly in the states of Oklahoma and North Carolina. (The Cherokee Nation is the sovereign operating government of the Cherokee people. It is a federally recognized tribe of more than 300,000 Cherokee citizens, with its capital located in Tahlequah, Okla. To learn more, please visit www.cherokee.org.) We\u2019re honored to have the opportunity to continue this tradition, and we\u2019d like to thank the Cherokee Nation for working with us to translate the interface for Google search into Cherokee. Search is now available in 146 interface languages\u2014and the list is growing. If you speak an endangered language that you would like us to support, please sign up for Google in Your Language and submit community translations. Update 10:26 AM: You can find the press release from the Cherokee Nation here.

Read how one engineering director tried Google App Engine for the first time to build an Android app\u2014now used by nearly half a million people\u2014during a 12-hour plane ride to Japan. -Ed. A 12-hour plane flight may seem daunting to some, but I look at it as uninterrupted time to do what I love\u2014code new products. My bi-monthly trips from London to Tokyo and California are how I spend my 20 percent time\u2014what I consider my \u201clicense to innovate.\u201d It was on a flight to Tokyo that I first built what became Chrome to Phone, an Android app and Chrome extension that allows you to instantly send content\u2014like a webpage, map or YouTube video\u2014from your Chrome browser to your Android device. As an engineering director, I spend the bulk of my time managing software engineers and various projects. As a result, there\u2019s not a lot of time to just sit at my desk and code, and it\u2019s possible for my technical skills to become rusty. So on one of my frequent cross-continent trips, I decided to take the opportunity\u2014and time\u2014to brush up on my engineering skills by exploring device-to-device interaction, an area that has a lot of potential in our increasingly connected world. I\u2019d never written a Chrome extension or used App Engine, a platform that allows developers to build web applications on the same scalable systems that power Google\u2019s own applications and services. But rather than sleeping or reading a book, I spent my flight figuring it out. And somewhere over Belgium on my way to Japan, I had a working prototype of Chrome to Phone. A few days later, on my trip back to London, I emailed my prototype to Andy Rubin and Linus Upson, who lead the Android and Chrome engineering teams. Before my plane even landed, they\u2019d both given the product their blessing. With a little help from a developer in Mountain View and a user interface designer back in London, we tidied things up and ultimately launched the open source code for Chrome to Phone at Google I/O just two months later. As an engineering director, I don\u2019t always have the time to get deeply involved in every aspect of a product launch. Chrome to Phone gave me a unique opportunity to be actively involved at the grassroots of product development at Google\u2014from concept to launch\u2014working directly with the legal, internationalization and consumer operations teams. With few restrictions on how I spent my time, I was able to build a prototype and launch it quickly, adding more features based on user feedback. Today, more than 475,000 people use the extension, and that number is still growing. When you\u2019re leaving your house to go out, you take your phone, keys and wallet. I don\u2019t think it will be long before you just take your phone\u2014it will contain everything that you need\u2014and that\u2019s our motivation to explore device-to-device interaction. In order to get there, we have engineers here in the U.K. and around the world examining the mobile space, both in their full-time roles and as 20 percent projects. There isn\u2019t only one solution, so by encouraging engineers to work on new projects, we hope that ideas will come from all over the world\u2014whether from a Google office or even 35,000 feet above one.

The diminutive superstar wowed a capacity crowd in a venue that was (literally) packed to the rafters with adoring Googlers. In a wide-ranging interview that saw Gaga taking questions from fans via Twitter and Moderator, the musician spoke about everything from bullying to Rebecca Black, the creative process and her upcoming album. She took questions from the audience\u2014hugging several Googlers in the process\u2014and even became a judge when a gaggle of Gaga-alikes flooded the stage. True to form, the singer was by turns funny, thoughtful and inspiring. But don\u2019t take our word for it\u2014you can watch the entire Q&A now on YouTube.

If you\u2019re not familiar with this series, we host talks by authors and commentators at Google, and post videos of their readings and talks on a dedicated YouTube channel. Authors@Google began in the fall of 2005 when we noticed that some amazing people were passing through the Google hallways. A few scrappy Googlers galvanized to create a more consistent pipeline of requests and a formalized program that kicked off with Malcolm Gladwell and James Surowiecki. As Google and our technology grew, so did the program. \u201cAuthors@Google\u201d has blossomed into @Google Talks, a full-fledged speaker series, expanded across distributed offices and found a home on YouTube, so that we can share these conversations outside of the Googleplex. The @Google Talks series aims to capture the popular and intellectual zeitgeist, as well as ideas that deserve a deeper focus an expert can provide in more than a five-minute soundbite. From the 2008 U.S. presidential candidates to Alice Walker to Michael Pollan to Raphael Saadiq, the program has grown to encompass not just authors, but musicians, innovators, notable women, chefs and more. The team that hosts these events is made up of dedicated and passionate volunteers from all across the company. Our most viral video was of Conan O'Brien, who stopped by during his \"Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television\" tour for a hilarious hour involving bagpipes, Andy Richter and one lucky Googler who got to touch his hair. We've featured master and apprentice\u2014from Thomas Keller of The French Laundry to Keller protege Corey Lee on the process of opening his new restaurant Benu\u2014and varying viewpoints, exemplified by Christopher Hitchens on \"God Is Not Great\" and Tim Keller on \"The Reason for God.\" And that\u2019s just the beginning. Other popular visitors include Congressman\u00a0Ron Paul, President Barack Obama, linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky, presentation designer Garr Reynolds, author Elizabeth Gilbert, Randall Munroe of XKCD and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. We\u2019re excited for what lies ahead, and we hope you'll tune in and join us.

As states develop assessments, curricula, and professional development based on the standards, and as teachers use them in the classroom, they will benefit from examples of student tasks that develop and assess those skills, understandings and practices. This project will develop a complete set of such tasks for each standard, ranging from easy to difficult, and from simple illustrations of single standards to complex tasks spanning many standards. The purpose of the project is to guide the work of states, assessment consortia, and testing companies by illustrating the range and types of mathematical work that students will experience in a faithful implementation of the standards. The process of selecting and reviewing tasks will pay attention both to what is known about how students think and to mathematical structure. A complete set of task will provide a reference map for assessment, curriculum design, and professional development. This website is currently under construction. On completion, it will provide a process for submitting, discussing, reviewing, and publishing tasks. It will also display the standards in multiple views and provide easy access to tasks associated with individual standards and tasks associated with higher order structures in the standards.

Bookmark Tweet Adding the final touches to a site can be the difference between a polished and beautiful site that looks \u201crefined,\u201d and a mediocre site that leaves no impression on visitors. jQuery, the versatile JavaScript library, can be leveraged to create all these fine tuned elements. Today we\u2019re going to look at how to use it to create elegant page transitions. Let\u2019s get to it! If you would like to quickly take a peek at a very simple implementation of this technique, below is the demo for viewing and download. Demo Download Getting Started With HTML/CSS To begin, let\u2019s dive straight into the CSS. We\u2019ll need to change the CSS for the and set it to display: none. body { display: none; } This will stop all of the visual elements in the body from loading, initially \u201chiding\u201d everything. Immediately, astute readers will realize that changing the body\u2019s display tag to none is risky. If visitors have JavaScript disabled, they won\u2019t be able to view the site. Therefore, a better solution will be adding the display:none CSS property using jQuery. If visitors have JavaScript disabled, they will still be able to see the body content. <script type=\"text/javascript\"> $(document).ready(function() { $(\"body\").css(\"display\", \"none\"); }); </script> Your HTML doesn\u2019t have to change much to get these transitions working, but before we get started on that, let\u2019s download and attach jQuery to our page. Visit jQuery and download the latest version of jQuery \u2013 it\u2019s easiest to just right-click the link and select \u201cSave Linked File As\u201d. I would suggest downloading the minified version since we\u2019re not going to be changing the source code, but just building on the library. After downloading jQuery , move the file to a favourable location of your choice in your site directory. Now let\u2019s see the HTML needed to attach jQuery to our site. <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/jquery-1.4.1.min.js\"></script> I suggest appending this in the head section of your document. It is advisable to attach all of your JavaScript at the end of your document to ensure a speedy loading time. However, we need this when the page loads and minified jQuery only comes in at a measly 74kb. Coding Page jQuery Transitions Once that\u2019s complete, we need to write the jQuery code that creates the fade transition. First, let\u2019s deal with page fade-ins. In the head section, code up the following: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> $(document).ready(function() { $(\"body\").css(\"display\", \"none\"); $(\"body\").fadeIn(2000); }); </script> The first line of the jQuery script assures that the document is ready before it applies the CSS and fades in. The second line applies the CSS style to hide the body so we can use jQuery to fade the page in. The third line calls the jQuery method to fadeIn the body over 2 seconds (feel free to play with the timings and see what you like). Now, if we fire up our browser we can see the new transition in action! But if we click on any of the links, our site disappears like normal. Wouldn't it be nice to have a subtle fade effect when visitors leave one page to go to another? Let's hook that function up. First, let\u2019s apply a special class on the links we wish to create a fade out effect. <a href=\"otherPage.html\" class=\"transition\">LINK</a> Now, if we go back to our HTML, we can modify our script to get some great looking jQuery fades. <script type=\"text/javascript\"> $(document).ready(function() { $(\"body\").css(\"display\", \"none\"); $(\"body\").fadeIn(2000); $(\"a.transition\").click(function(event){ event.preventDefault(); linkLocation = this.href; $(\"body\").fadeOut(1000, redirectPage); }); function redirectPage() { window.location = linkLocation; } }); </script> Now, we\u2019ve asked our jQuery script to listen for visitors that click on anchors with a class of transition. If a visitor does click on it, the script immediately cancels the browser redirect, then saves the destination URL in a variable called linkLocation. We then fade out the body of the page over a second, but also pass a second argument that requires the redirectPage function to be called when the animation is completed. The redirectPage function just serves to redirect the browser after the content of your page fully fades out. Fine Tuning That\u2019s it! You have everything all set up and you\u2019re ready to rock and roll! But there are a couple of things to mention. These page fades will look much better if you set a specified background color for the html tag similar to the color of your site\u2019s background color in your CSS. This means when the body fades in and out, there is still a color similar to the existing background you have. html { /*If you had a black or close to black background*/ background-color: #000000; } Also, it\u2019s not a bad idea to externalize this script. Remove the script from your HTML and put it in its own .js file and then attach it the same way you did for the jQuery file (but it must be attached after). It\u2019s always a good practice to keep content, presentation and interaction separate. Here\u2019s a quick look of how my files are organized. Also, if you want to have all links from your page fade-out, you don\u2019t need to specify which ones to have the transition class; we can just make all your links create the fade. To do this, just replace the third line of the script, changing the jQuery selector from $(\"a.transition\") to just $(\"a\") and remove all the \u201ctransition\u201d classes from your anchors. Demo Download Conclusion Using this page fade can make your site stand out as very few sites use this technique. However, be careful to keep the transitions subtle. Used correctly, this jQuery gem will polish and make your site stand out.

It delays the speed users navigate through the website. Maybe you can preload the next page during the animation, so only the loading time will be reduced? Otherwise, a good example! Reply Widi Mawardi February 27, 2011 at 2:19 am I agree with you macro delays the speed could be mean losing some visitor Reply Michael Wilson February 23, 2010 at 7:16 pm Nice technique. In firefox though if you click on the back button the previous page doesn't load. It's a nice idea but I agree with Marco, i don't think it's great for the users flow.

I've tried to make it works even we click on the back button by adding display:none property on the body : body { font-size: 62.5%; font-family: Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; background: #333; color: #fff; display: none; } And put the fadeIn function in the displayPage function to put on the addEventListener function : function displayPage() { $(\"body\").fadeIn(2000); } window.addEventListener(\"load\", displayPage, false); window.addEventListener(\"unload\", displayPage, false); Reply Terrance February 23, 2010 at 9:33 pm Thanks for the solution. It works! 1 additional point will be adding $(\"body\").css(\"display\", \"none\"); into the displayPage() function. function displayPage() { $(\"body\").css(\"display\", \"none\"); $(\"body\").fadeIn(2000); } So that even if visitors have their JavaScript disabled, they will still be able to see the body content. Reply nae April 9, 2010 at 7:27 pm OK, great! nb: for this to work, don't add \"display: none;\" in the css page for the body{} Reply Ivor February 23, 2010 at 10:13 pm It looks weird in Chrome. Reply Mathias Bynens February 23, 2010 at 10:15 pm Right now, the content flashes for a second, then after the JavaScript is loaded it gets hidden only to fade in again.

I have about a dozen divs within a page that are hidden, I'd like to use this effect just for those links... Reply Damien April 27, 2010 at 5:21 pm Just replace body with the div id and ad a link with a click function: $(document).ready(function() { $(\"#id-of-hidden-div\").css(\"display\", \"none\"); $(\"#id-of-link-to-div\").click(function() { $(\"#id-of-hidden-div\").fadeIn(2000); }); }); Reply Gabriel February 24, 2010 at 3:47 am Nice, but if the client have disable js, the body is empty :S:S:S Reply Damien May 9, 2010 at 4:35 pm Just think for one second... disabling javascript is almost as useful as disabling images. Why disable images? Really load time these days is not an issue. Why disable javascript? The only time I ever do this is if I find a site that refuses to reveal it's sources. Other then that? So: \"client have disable js?\" not likely, but if so do you really care to cattier to these clients with such poor web standards. Or maybe we are all better off without. Reply It's 2010 August 8, 2010 at 12:05 am Virtually nobody disables javascript anymore. The average user doesn't even know how to do it and if a person does have javascript disabled, they're navigating with a very particular purpose that requires it. Anyone who disables their javascript is smart enough to know (or by now has realized) that they are not going to have a full web experience. We really can't worry about that stuff anymore. Reply Robert Rowe February 24, 2010 at 6:09 am ...like it! Reply Ethan Gardner February 24, 2010 at 10:49 am Not bad, but it could be easily improved by assigning $('body') to a variable and referencing the variable on subsequent instances. That will cache the result of the selector, meaning that you'd only be looking up the value one time instead of three like you are doing in this script. Reply DRoss February 25, 2010 at 10:10 am Tried it out - but with the flickering and back button breaking I can't use it. I saw it on another site a few weeks ago but couldn't remember where. So nice job but needs more fine tuning. Reply Stephan Wehner February 25, 2010 at 10:30 am At http://www.shaynekelly.com I did something similar, and added a unonload hook to deal with the back button. Not perfect either. Stephan Reply Rudi February 25, 2010 at 12:42 pm I think we can use this effect as an alternative for page loader effect, maybe you can add more effect to this ( not just fade in / out ), it will be more interesting cheers Reply SM February 26, 2010 at 8:28 pm Great plugin.

I tried to find out how you managed not to fire the fadeIn-transaition unless the whole content is loaded, but failed. I think this is needed to prevent the short flash displaying the sites content before fading in. Beyond that you managed the issue with the back button. Could you please give me/us a short advise? Thanks a lot. Reply Chris March 19, 2010 at 12:48 pm Haha I remember in 1999 / 2000 This was pretty popular.. they even had some extension for dreamweaver just for this ^^ Reply Jan April 3, 2010 at 2:17 pm hello, giving a css display:none value you risk to be detected by google as hiding content. So from the SEO point of view it can be harmful. I don't know if actually googlebot reads inside javascript code, but if not, it will do it soon. You should use a more solid alternative, for example the JQuery animate function with parameters : opacity 0 and animation length 0 milliseconds. Reply Damien April 27, 2010 at 5:38 pm LOMAO! That's funny. 1st Google uses this same technique on their own site, so they're not going to kick you for having a display:none. In fact Google bots will not flag you for this unless the content within the div is suspicious (keyword stuffing). The only way you get banned for hiding content in most cases is if a live Google moderator happens upon your link and sees you are abusing this method. Google posted something about this a few years ago. Reply Troy Dean May 13, 2010 at 7:05 pm Google don't need to optimise their site for Google.

This code works great in google chrome, but in safari and firefox is you navigate away from the page and hit the browsers back button, you get presented with a white page. So i used .bind unload like this: $(document).ready(function() { $(window).bind(\"unload\", function() { }); $(\"body\").css(\"display\", \"none\"); $(\"body\").fadeIn(1000); --- rest of the code --- }); Works like a charm in both firefox and safari.....or at least for me. hope this helps someone. Cheers! Reply Marius May 9, 2010 at 5:29 pm Revision: Works an looks good in safari and firefox, but flickers like crazy in chrome. To solve the flickering i changed my code like this: $(document).ready(function() { $(window).bind(\"unload\", function() { }); $(\"body\").css(\"overflow\", \"hidden\") $(\"body\").hide(); $(\"body\").fadeIn(1000); --- rest of the code --- }); Reply Tim May 10, 2010 at 5:18 am Thanks Marius! I have the whole site loading with the fade effect now. And it's sweet!!! However, I'm having a little trouble when the initial (home) page loads. When it loads, the actual page will flicker, disappear, then fade in... My code for the script (linked externally) is as follows: ________________________________________________ $(document).ready(function() { $(window).bind(\"unload\", function() { }); $(\"body\").css(\"display\", \"none\"); $(\"body\").hide(); $(\"body\").fadeIn(700); $(\"a.transition\").click(function(event){ event.preventDefault(); linkLocation = this.href; $(\"body\").fadeOut(700, redirectPage); }); function redirectPage() { window.location = linkLocation; } }); ______________________________ What does anyone recommend for this problem or are we going to have to live with it? It only does it sometimes, not always... Reply Marius May 10, 2010 at 2:04 pm Hey Tim! Glad i could help. I had a little test page where i played with the effect. Later, after i posted the code above, i saw that if you have a bigger page that doesn't fit your display, the $(\"body\").css(\"overflow\", \"hidden\") is going to cut the page to fit your display and disable the browsers scroll. So, try replacing $(\"body\").css(\"display\", \"none\"); in your code with $(\"body\").css(\"overflow\", \"scroll\") That worked for me, the hole page is shown and no white flickering, hope it works for you as well. Cheers! Reply Tim May 10, 2010 at 9:06 pm Cool! I actually want the scrollbar on there at all times so there is no page shifts when going to another page. This effect doesn't seem to be working with spry tooltips either. Don't know why. Can you possibly help me with that? You guys are so helpful thanks a bunch... Tim Reply Marius May 11, 2010 at 2:12 pm Hey Tim, Sorry, can't help you with spry, but you could try one of the numerous jquery tooltip plugins.

Ideas? Reply Amri July 10, 2010 at 6:31 am True that this script won't work with IE. Also, somehow, and I've tested alot of different things with the html- and body tag, the backgrond image won't fade. On the 127site the background image does fade. And, the flicker is still there. Any suggestions, anyone? Reply Stephan Wehner July 10, 2010 at 6:59 am Since Amri asked, \"Any suggestions, anyone?\" ... here's an idea that occurred to me. Probably a bit of an effort to implement. Link clicks are not changed. But the HTML returned to the browser depends on the referrer field in the HTTP header. This field tells you which page the visitor is currently viewing. The server sends back the HTML belonging to the currently viewed page (even for the new page!) and also HTML for the new page. Also added is javascript to switch/fade from the old page to the new page. So: * User visits some page on the site: no special action. * User clicks on link on the site that goes to a page within the site: Server responds with HTML that contains both HTML for the previously viewed page and HTML for the new page. Javascript switches/fades from old to new HTML. I think this could be very robust for all browsers. Hope this is understandable, if not, I'll try to explain a bit more. Stephan Reply Amri July 10, 2010 at 8:47 am Nice suggestion Stephan. Sounds like a sound and solid idea. Any code to try what you are suggesting? I'm not a coder... Amri Reply Stephan Wehner July 10, 2010 at 8:55 am Amri, demo might take me a month or two; kind of busy with other stuff. -- Stephan Reply Amri July 10, 2010 at 9:07 am Ok Stephan.

I was desperate searching in google how to implement a fadeout effect on a web I'm buliding... and suddenly I found your article. THANK YOU!!! Reply Jeff August 12, 2010 at 9:57 am I love this idea, but i dont know how to apply it to frames. For example, i have a navigation bar and when i click on a link, I want the other frame (content frame) to fade out, how would I accomplish this? I tried a few things, but it made the navigation frame fade out, and then when the transition was done, i got the content to load in the right frame, but it deleted the navigation frame. Reply Amrit August 21, 2010 at 6:33 am Just realized after using this gem, that I need the effect on all links, except for external ones, eg. all with target=\"_blank\", or using another jQuery call to open the external links in a new window. Is there any way I can add this script to all links like this: $(document).ready(function() { $(window).bind(\"unload\", function() { }); $(\"body\").css(\"display\", \"none\"); $(\"body\").hide(); $(\"body\").fadeIn(700); $(\"a\").click(function(event){ event.preventDefault(); linkLocation = this.href; $(\"body\").fadeOut(700, redirectPage); }); function redirectPage() { window.location = linkLocation; } }); And then somehow exclude the links with a class of external, or a target set to _blank? Reply Jason September 11, 2010 at 2:36 am Demo down? Reply redneckliberal September 16, 2010 at 2:17 am Thanks for this. Works great except I could not kill the white flicker without building a separate jquery animation js to handle fade-ins and used yours only for the fade outs. Not sure why, but IE is (as always) the one that makes you work hard! Reply Sam Jarvis September 28, 2010 at 6:06 pm I've got a perhaps better method of fading in a page. Load the page with a width&height 100% black square + the site under it. Then you can use PHP to check if the user has js enabled. Check if the user has javascript on, if so, fade the box out and display:none it when finished fading. If js is disabled, then... you might be able to use PHP to remove the box. Haven't tested this. But, I would think that fading a box out, rather than fading the body tag would be more efficient, less cpu intensive. Reply Daniel Medi October 15, 2010 at 8:05 am Whit this script works a little better with that IE blsht $(document).ready(function() { $(\"body\").css(\"display\", \"none\"); $(\"img\").css(\"display\", \"none\"); $(\"body\").fadeIn(1000); $(\"img\").fadeIn(1000); $(\"a.transition\").click(function(event){ event.preventDefault(); linkLocation = this.href; $(\"body\").fadeOut(1000, redirectPage); $(\"img\").fadeOut(1000, redirectPage); }); function redirectPage() { window.location = linkLocation; } }); Reply thinayr October 28, 2010 at 3:04 pm Thank you so much for this!

Reply Thijs December 13, 2010 at 8:07 pm Hi, Thanks! What fixed the flicker for me is having a container div fade instead of body, while body still has the background. $(window).bind(\"unload\", function() { }); $(\"#page\").css(\"display\", \"none\"); $(\"#page\").hide(); $(\"#page\").fadeIn(700); $(\"a\").click(function(event){ event.preventDefault(); linkLocation = this.href; $(\"#page\").fadeOut(700, redirectPage); }); function redirectPage() { window.location = linkLocation; } Reply Nik February 7, 2011 at 9:01 pm Like this effect but had major problems with original code. Then read posts from Marius and got things working a lot better using this code: $(document).ready(function() { $(window).bind(\"unload\", function() { }); $(\"body\").hide(); $(\"body\").fadeIn(700); $(\"a.fade\").click(function(event){ event.preventDefault(); linkLocation = this.href; $(\"body\").fadeOut(700, redirectPage); }); function redirectPage() { window.location = linkLocation; } }); Website I am currently testing on has background styled in html tag so did not have same problems with white flashes. Marius' suggestion of adding \"jQuery(\"body\").css(\"overflow\", \"hidden\")\" did cause problems with adding scroll bars where not needed. Also had problems with lightbox script problems that the noConflict command did not solve. Finally arrived at the solution by changing to \"a.fade\" and adding \"fade\" class to all links except slideshow and a popup link. Now getting good results in all browsers (except IE). Will Try Daniel Medi idea next. I suspect best fix will be suggestion to wrap everything in a div tag. However, I have just finished rewriting site to HTML5 and am overjoyed to have pages without one single div! Reply Owain February 10, 2011 at 1:31 am I was worried that for random periods of long loading (large mysql query or high server load etc.) user might be wondering what was going on with plain white screen. Instead of fading out the body, fade out the div wrapper and insert an absolutely positioned loading GIF above it in the code - which will display behind it on the page. This means that on fade out the loading GIF fades in and fades back out on the next page loading in: Yes the CSS is mixed in blah, blah - it's just for ease of reading: You can position it how you like, I just happened to have a fixed layout and used left/top positioning. Z-index's ensure that the gif is underneath. Z-indexes require a positional style to be declared. Also make sure your #wrapper has a background set so the loading.gif doesn't just show through it. This is my two penneth - there are obviously plenty of cleaner ways etc. - this was just to show the general idea of having a loading GIF behind the faded out div. Hope it helps someone Reply dubai web designing February 22, 2011 at 1:54 pm am looking for something like this, but instead of fade in, can i get slide in option (i know there is a jquery for slide in page effect, but it need single page) anyway to get slide in style in multiple page website ?

The installation of a car starter is just as important as the features on your remote car starter of choice because if it\u2019s not done right it will either not work correctly or can cause damage to today\u2019s sophisticated automotive electronics systems. When searching for remote car starter of choice, one of the first things to look at is the warranty. Most reputable car alarm companies will offer a warranty for as long as you own your car typically referred to as a lifetime warranty. The Viper 5902 remote car starter for example, does offer a lifetime limited warranty as well as a reasonable transmitter range. The Viper 5902\u2019s range of one mile is judged by line of site in perfect conditions, but there are some variables in which the actual range will vary. While most people are happy with a range long enough to reach their car parked in their driveway, they forget about going to the mall or to a sports outing where they will be parked far away. Being able to have the car started and cooled off or warmed up doesn\u2019t seem important to them until they are almost to their vehicle and realize it\u2019s still not running. Buying from a reputable company is paramount to having the remote car starter of choice and Viper has been around since 1989, when it grew from the auto alarm business, Directed Electronics that had its beginning in 1982 in Cleveland, Ohio. The company moved to San Diego in 1986, introducing the Viper and Python brands and has since grown into the most recognized name in anti-theft and remote starter companies in the world. Professional installation protects investment There are numerous retailers that may sell your remote car starter of choice but do not offer installation. There are some companies that will install remote starters from a third party vendor, but there can be two issues with this process. First, the installer may not be familiar with the brand or they may not be familiar with some of the features of the vehicle in which it is being installed. For example, by buying a Viper 5902 from a shop that also installs this product, you can be assured that all of the functions of the remote start of choice will work properly and will not damage your vehicle. However, buying it from a big box retailer may get you a reduced price, having it installed by a neighbor, or yourself, could end up costing more in car repairs than you bargained for. After market products may not void warranties Car retailers often misinform their customers that installing an after market remote car starter of choice will void their new vehicle warranty when in fact, this is not true. Although a starter installed incorrectly can damage the vehicle\u2019s electronics, which in turn can void the warranty, making it important to have it installed by an experienced professional. The Viper 5902 has an intuitive remote control that can teach the new user how to use the many functions of the remote without worrying about making a mistake. If something does pop up they weren\u2019t expecting, detailed instructions are available to get them back on the right track. If you have two vehicles and want both equipped with your remote car starter of choice, the Viper 5902 allows you to use them simultaneously. The visual remote keeps users informed about the status of the vehicle, if it is running or even if it\u2019s available to determine if one vehicle needs to be shut down or disarmed for use. When selecting your remote car starter of choice, the features you will need the most should be much more important than price. Features such as keyless entry, shock sensor and dome light supervision may not be available on many remote starter units. They are, along with a host of other user-friendly features available on the Viper 5902. This entry was posted in Uncategorized.

That\u2019s a big subject. Where do we start when we\u2019re talking about something that\u00a0isn\u2019t\u00a0here yet?In this article, we\u2019ll look at what the future Web might look like and how we can adapt our current skills to this new environment, as well as how to create fluid websites that are built around a consistent core and that adapt to the limitations and features of the device on which they are viewed. We\u2019ll also look at how our conceptual approach to designing websites should evolve: designing from the simplest design upwards, and not from the richest website down.But before we get to that, let\u2019s start with a question. What do we mean by the \u201cfuture Web\u201d?What Is The Future Web?Back in the old days: analogous Google queries would have taken 30 days. Image: dullhunkThe one word that I hear more than any other at the moment is mobile.\u00a0Mobile websites, mobile devices, mobile apps: the list seems to go on and on. In fact, a large swell of opinion says that the future Web is mobile.But despite all this, focusing just on mobile isn\u2019t the answer.The way we access the Internet is changing, of that we can be certain. And in the short term, this does mean more mobile devices. But in the long term, we have to look a little wider. Thomas Husson, senior analyst for Forrester, summed it up nicely in his 2011 Mobile Trends report when he said, \u201cThe term mobile will mean a lot more than mobile phones.\u201d In the long term, the word we should use instead of mobile is portable.Why Portable? How Has the Internet Changed to Make It So?First, the physical infrastructure of the Internet is spreading rapidly, so that our ability to access the Internet wherever we are grows daily. In the last 10 years, the number of Internet users has grown by 444.8% and now includes 28.7% of the population. That\u2019s nearly 2 billion people, the majority of whom are in Asia. This growth is fuelled by investment in the underlying hardware that gives us access to the Internet: millions and millions of computers, millions of miles of cables, hundreds of thousands of wireless hotspots and, on top of all this, growing 3G coverage around the globe (around 21% by the end of 2010 according to Morgan Stanley).Secondly, the way we use the Internet is changing. We are increasingly orienting our online experience around services rather than search engines. Services such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn are becoming the hub for our online life, and we are blending them to create our own unique Web of content: Facebook for our social life, LinkedIn for our professional life, Spotify for music, Netflix for television and film. We\u2019re seeing a very different form of information consumption here, one in which we expect information to be pushed to us through our social circle, the people whom we trust. We\u2019re moving away from the old paradigm of information retrieval, in which we are expected to seek information using search engines and links.Some of these services are tied to a single device, but increasingly they are available across multiple platforms, including the desktop, mobile apps, Internet-enabled TVs and others. Only last month, Samsung created the first tweeting refrigerator. Okay, that might not be the greatest use of an Internet connection, but it is an example of how these services are starting to spread out, away from the desktop and into our everyday lives. Evrythng, a start-up currently in beta, is working on a platform that would give any physical object an online presence, effectively making the Internet an ubiquitous entity containing data that can be consumed anywhere and by anything.Given these changes, it\u2019s important that we not be overly rigid in our approach to creating new Web content; we mustn\u2019t allow ourselves to think in terms of devices. Right now, we are producing mobile apps and standard websites to deliver our services, but in a few years\u2019 time, we may be looking at a completely different landscape, one where knowing exactly where and how our content is being viewed is impossible. Our content must be portable in the sense that it can be displayed anywhere. Media marketers have responded to the increasing use of mobile media. (Image: birgerking)We may also find ourselves having to decide whether to concentrate on particular devices and channels at the expense of audience numbers or to take a less tailored approach and serve the widest spectrum possible.Regardless of the route we take, the ability to deliver a consistent experience across all channels is paramount, and our ability as designers and developers to understand the options and deliver this consistency to our clients will be crucial.So, this is the future Web, a mish-mash of devices and channels. Sounds good, doesn\u2019t it? Let\u2019s go back to the key word, portability.How Do We Design For The Portable Web?Ask yourself, how would your latest project cope in the following scenarios:The user is watching House on their new Internet TV. Hugh Laurie\u2019s not on screen, so the user decides to check their email. A friend has sent a link to your website, which the user opens in a sidebar and views simultaneously with the program.The user is on a train back from work, probably delayed somewhere, accessing your website via 3G on an iPadThe user is on a client\u2019s website. They need to access your website to read an article, but they have only a company-supplied Sony Ericsson with Opera Mini installed.Each of these scenarios presents us with a different problem to solve: (1) an odd aspect-ratio and browser combination, (2) a good display area but slow connection and (3) a very small display area. And they are all very possible scenarios. The first Internet TVs by big brands are now available from the big retailers. Opera Mini has over 85.5 million users and is the dominant browser in many areas of the world; in fact, in Asia, Opera and Nokia (with their combined 66.33% market share) are way ahead of the third-place browser (which is BlackBerry, with a 9.81% share). And Deloitte has predicted that 2011 will be the year of the tablet and that 50% of the \u201ccomputing devices\u201d sold will not be PCs.Chances are that, unless you\u2019ve really thought about it (and if you have, then you probably don\u2019t need to read this article), your website won\u2019t work in all of those cases.When designing for the portable Web, we need to be aware of three things: design, content and integration. Approached in the right way, we can create websites that are accessible across the widest user base and that provide a consistent experience regardless of access method.Consistent? How?When faced with a multitude of devices to design for, all with varying specifications, the last goal that might come to mind is consistency, and with good reason. And yet we should be striving to achieve consistency. Not in design but in experience.Conceptually, we should be thinking about our design in two layers: the core content or service, and then the display layer. The core of our website should not change from device to device, and it should deliver a consistent experience. As we shall see shortly, this means that we must ensure that elements such as the content and the navigation patterns work the same way always.The web\u2019s future consists of vast possibilities, considering them all is virtually impossible. That is why we need consistency! Image: Juhan SoninLet\u2019s say our user is at work and is browsing our website on an iPad. They work through the carefully designed navigation hierarchy to get to the piece of content that they want to read, but they are interrupted by a phone call and have to stop browsing. Later, on the train home, they access the website again, this time via their phone. The visual elements of the design will be different\u2014by necessity\u2014but crucially, the routes they took to find the content should be exactly the same, as should the content they read when they got there.This consistency of experience is what will allow us to create great websites for the portable Web and a complete user experience.Where Do I Start? And How Will I Know When I Get There?If a single consistent experience is our goal, this begs the question, should we create a mobile website that scales up or a desktop website that degrades?The answer is\u00a0neither. We should try to create a single design that can be used across all devices without alteration. But in practice, at least for the moment, we should start with the simplest website and work up.Why? Let\u2019s go back to the introduction. On the portable Web, we have no control over how our content will be used or viewed, and as such we must throw out the idea that we are designing for a particular device or device size. We must approach the design of our website in a different way, one in which we create the core content or service first. After all, this will define our website in the end, not the visual elements. This may seem difficult initially, but as we shall see, many of the best practices for desktop website development hold true for the portable Web, especially with regard to content structure.<img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/3096440676_40d71ed11c.j alt=\" in Designing For The Future Web\" />WE need consistency like the inside of a pepper. Image by Sean RogersTo recap, here are the key rules to bear in mind when working through a design for the portable Web:The website should be available to as wide an audience as possible;The website should contain the same content wherever it is viewed, where feasible;The website\u2019s structure should be the same wherever it is viewed;The content should be displayed in a manner that is appropriate to its environment.A website that meets all of these criteria would fit snugly in the future portable Web. But how do we go about making our websites do this?Designing For The Portable WebDesign Using Web Standards: That Means HTML5 The good news is that the two most common browser engines on mobile, Webkit and Opera, both support HTML5 very well; Webkit has supported HTML5 at least partially since November 2007.Using standard and descriptive mark-up throughout our websites will have the benefit of delivering consistent output across most devices. And the extended capabilities of HTML5 to deliver media, animation and local storage make it a great choice for mobile applications.These three abilities allow HTML5 websites to reproduce behaviours usually associated with native mobile applications, closing the experience gap between the two. Video can now be played natively through HTML5 using the video tag, while animations can be played using the HTML5 canvas. Finally, local storage allows a website to store database-like information on the device, allowing for fully functional offline use of the website.YouTube, Netflix and Gmail all have HTML5 versions of their websites that are designed for the mobile experience and that take advantage of the new capabilities of HTML5. They\u2019re a great starting point for any developer who wants to see what can be achieved.HTML5 is now ready to be used for development, and there\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t start right away. Many excellent resources and tutorials are available to help you get started:Dive into HTML5 An overview of the HTML5 standard and a great starting point.HTML5 Demos and Examples A series of demonstrations showing the capabilities of HTML5, with source code.HTML5 Gallery A showcase of websites created in HTML5.To get started using HTML5 in your projects, you can take advantage of any one of the number of development environments that support it. The most complete implementation is through Adobe\u2019s Dreamweaver CS5; an HTML5 support pack can be downloaded that extends the built-in editor. Aptana also supports HTML5 in its beta of Aptana Studio 3. Links are provided at the end of this article.Start Simple, Work UpThinking portable means thinking clean and simple. The wide variation in screen sizes\u2014from a 40-inch LCD running at 1920 \u00d7 1080 pixels to a portrait-orientation mobile screen at 320 \u00d7 240 pixels\u2014means that we must create designs that are scalable and adaptive. We must also be aware that someone may be interacting via a remote control or a fat stubby finger on a touchscreen. The simpler the design, the more adaptable it will be.Bottom up conceptualizing males sense. Concentrate on the basic elements and let the context evolve around them. Image: Andrei BocanCreate your basic website structure first and add only your core styles, the ones that are applicable to all devices and layouts. Starting simple gives us a great base on which to build. Essentially, we are starting from the most basic experience, available on even the smallest mobile device, and working our way up to the more capable desktop browsers.Using @media queries in the CSS will enable your website to recognize the additional capabilities of desktop browsers and scale up for these environments, presenting a fuller and more interactive experience where possible.A word of caution and a reason why we don\u2019t work the other way around by degrading a desktop website to a mobile one: @media queries are not supported by every mobile device. Rachel Andrews provides a good overview of @media queries\u00a0here on Smashing Magazine, albeit working from desktop to mobile, rather than the other way round.Forget About ProprietaryWhatever you do, stay away from the proprietary technologies, because that\u2019s the one way to guarantee an inconsistent experience. Flash and Silverlight as development platforms are living on borrowed time. Microsoft has already indicated that it will discontinue Silverlight development to concentrate on HTML5, while Flash is being used mainly as a game development platform and video-delivery mechanism. If we are going to create truly cross-platform websites that display consistently across all devices, then Flash and Silverlight are not wise choices because we cannot be certain that they will be installed on the user\u2019s device. Not to say that Flash doesn\u2019t have its place; as a platform for Web-based games, it is currently unrivalled. It\u2019s about choosing the best technologies for the job at hand.Be Wary of JavaScript\u2026 for the Time BeingThe bad news is that we may have to sacrifice some of the things we take for granted now. We must learn to design for unknown screen sizes and ratios and allow content to flow as required. Think less about design structure and page layout and more about content structure.We may have to forgo using JavaScript and AJAX (both staples of desktop development) to create more involving user experiences, because some lower-end devices will not have the hardware muscle to deal with complex libraries. Trimming page weight will also be a priority because we cannot be certain that end users will have broadband-speed access to the Internet, so large libraries will be unacceptable overhead.This is particularly important in light of the recent \u201chash bang\u201d trend, started with Gawker Media\u2019s controversial redesign of its websites. The websites (including Gizmodo, Lifehacker and Gawker) present a more application-like experience to users, but do so by relying on JavaScript for content delivery. In effect, the websites consist of a single page that is loaded with dynamic content on request, instead of the multiple pages that they consisted of previously. Any users whose browsers cannot process the JavaScript, for whatever reason, will be unable to browse the website; they are greeted with only a blank page.However, a number of libraries are being developed to be lightweight and usable on portable devices. jQuery has an alpha of its mobile library available for testing. The project has the backing of industry players such as BlackBerry, Mozilla and Adobe, so it is worth keeping an eye on.JavaScript support will mature as devices worldwide move onto more modern platforms and as older devices are taken out of service. But for the time being, a conservative approach to its use will mean a wider potential audience for your work.Test, Test, Then Test AgainOn the portable Web, there\u2019s a good chance we won\u2019t be able to test against every possible platform on which our content will be viewed. But that doesn\u2019t take away the need to test. And test we must. Opera Mini\u2019s emulator lets you test your website in a virtual browser.Buying a device from each platform would be prohibitive for the majority of designers. But alternatives are available. For most of the main platforms, device emulators are available that simulate the browsing experience. See the resources section at the end of this article for links.At the other end of the scale, a paid service is available from DeviceAnywhere, which enables you to test your website on over 2000 handsets.Unfortunately, there are no Internet TV emulators so far, but Google has released a guide to designing for Google TV.Finally, of course, we mustn\u2019t forget to test on our desktop browsers, too. The aim of designing for the portable Web is to create a single experience across as wide a set of devices as possible. Just because users are able to browse the Web in many ways doesn\u2019t mean they will stop using their desktop, laptop or netbook. Use this to your advantage when testing simply by resizing your browser to ensure that your design scales and flows appropriately. The emulators will provide you with an exact rendering of your website on other devices.The Ugly Duckling?So, does the portable Web defy beauty and kick sand in the face of outstanding design? Of course not. Great design is not only about visual imagery, but about presenting information clearly, which involves hierarchy and importance through innovative and well-thought out typography, layouts and navigation. Which brings us to\u2026Content For The Portable WebContent is once again king. The rise of Quora should be enough to convince anyone of that; it is a service based solely on content. On the portable Web, this is doubly true. By paring down the design elements, you leave even more focus on the content.Understand What\u2019s ImportantIdentifying what is most critical to users should be your first task when developing a portable website. There may not be room for complex navigation, especially on smaller screens, so keep it simple. Compare the mobile and desktop versions of YouTube\u2019s start page: YouTube\u2019s standard home page. YouTube\u2019s HTML5-based home page works brilliantly on small screens.Create a Solid Information HierarchyStructuring our content is important, for both readability and SEO. Understanding the content that we are presenting is essential to creating clear information hierarchies that guide users through it.Map the user\u2019s possible journeys through your content. There should be a clear route to every piece of content, starting with the top-level information categories and getting more granular with each click. John Lewis\u2019 mobile website has a clear information hierarchy to aid navigation.A good example of this is the mobile website of John Lewis, a UK-based department store. From the home page, you can easily drill down to each department, and from there to individual products. It\u2019s simple, and it also means that the amount of information on any given page is not overwhelming and that you know exactly where you are in the hierarchy at all times.Keep Content AvailableEven if users aren\u2019t on a desktop, don\u2019t treat them as second-class citizens. Provide as much content as is feasible. And for what content there is, present it appropriately. Remove the following:Superfluous images If an image isn\u2019t essential to the content, get rid of it.Unsupported file formats Don\u2019t include Flash or even the Flash placeholder if the file likely can\u2019t be played.Unnecessary text Good desktop copy doesn\u2019t necessarily make for good portable copy. Is that second customer testimonial absolutely necessary? If not, remove it.While we want to remove unnecessary content, we don\u2019t want to remove too much. In the example below, we have a simple accessible website, but one that has no depth. The first level of information is presented well, but the headings for the company\u2019s services at the bottom of the page should link to the next level of information. The way it is, if I want to find out more, I\u2019m forced to visit the non-optimized website. This is a poor user experience, because it makes finding what I need more difficult. Sapient Nitro\u2019s mobile website displays really well but cuts a lot of information from the full website.Integration And The Portable WebIf services are to become the new hub of the Internet, keeping our websites linked to these services becomes paramount.Keep It ModularServices will come and go (although the main ones will certainly remain for a long time yet\u2026 yes, I\u2019m looking at you, Facebook), so keep your design modular. Being able to integrate with new services as they come online and to prune away those that have fallen by the wayside will ensure that your content is available to the widest possible audience.The goal is to make it easy to push your content across multiple services and thus integrate your content into the fabric of the Web. Primarily, this will be through search engine optimization and social sharing.Make Your Content Search-Engine FriendlyWhile the way people access content is becoming more social and less search-based, search engines are still a massive source of traffic. Keeping your content formatted for easy retrieval is a must. Quora has done this extremely well, leading to high rankings across the major search engines and generating traffic for its next-generation Q&A service. SEO may be old hat for some, but as quality of content becomes increasingly important, it will gain new life. Quora plays nice with search engines, with great results.Make Sharing EasySEO is important, but so are direct connections to other services through OAuth, OpenGraph and OpenID. If this isn\u2019t an option for you, then at the very least give users some way to share your content. Services like AddThis and ShareThis make it simple to add sharing capabilities; take advantage of them. A single tweet can generate a lot of activity. Of course, modern development and content platforms such as WordPress have this functionality built in.Bringing these three elements together will create websites that are discoverable, consistent and usable. Just one question now is raising its ugly head\u2026What About Apps? Aren\u2019t They The Way Forward? Apps are big business. Gartner forecasts that mobile app store revenue will top $15 billion in 2011. It\u2019s no surprise that Google, Microsoft, Nokia and others are trying to get in on the act. But just because app stores are commercially successful, does it mean they should be our first point of call when designing for the future Web?Let\u2019s look at why one might want to create an app:Easy to purchase, install, use and throw away Apps are so usable that even your granny could use them. Installing them on a smartphone is a smooth process that requires minimal involvement from the user. And when you\u2019ve had enough, you simply delete it and no trace of the app remains. This is a great user experience, period. That\u2019s why Apple is now pushing the same concept for full-blown Mac apps through the Mac App Store. Apps also provide, in most cases, a good user experience, with their native controls and design patterns.Brand association and lock-in Apps are designed to do one thing and do it well. The most successful apps are exercises in brand association: \u201cI want to search the Web, so I\u2019ll use the Google app,\u201d or \u201cI want to check up on my friends, so I\u2019ll use the Facebook app.\u201d You experience the brand through the app. I could easily use the Safari browser on the iPhone to access both Facebook and Google, but the apps make it easy for me. I\u2019m locked into the experience, which is great for the companies because their brands get planted square in the middle of my home screen; in this case, a big F and a big G.Money The most attractive thing about apps to many companies is the profit. Apple\u2019s App Store has shown that monetizing content is possible. Even for independent developers, making a lot of money in a relatively short period of time is possible.What\u2019s remarkable about all of these points is that they have nothing to do with information consumption. They are all about brand and user experience. However, there are also reasons why you should think twice:Apps are information silos: Apps do what they do well. But they don\u2019t do a good job of bringing in the wider Web. Want to follow a link? You might be able to view the page in app, but you\u2019re just as likely to get thrown out into the browser. That\u2019s not a good user experience. You also lose control of the user\u2019s actions and their focus on your content.Apps are platform-specific: Writing an app automatically ties you to the platform you are writing it for. This immediately limits your potential audience. Smartphone penetration is growing but is still a small segment of the overall Internet-enabled phone market. To take the US market as an example, even though 31% of the population have smartphones, only 6% of the population have iPhones. That\u2019s 19 million out 307 million. If you released an iOS-only app in the US, you would immediately lose 76.17 million potential users.Apps work best for big brands and services: Regardless of how good the app is, you have to find a way to get it discovered among the tidal wave of apps that are released into app stores every day. Big brands can push their apps through their existing Web presence, but that\u2019s a lot more difficult for smaller brands. And unless you can generate a lot of relevant content regularly, as the major services do, your app will be consigned to the trash very quickly. Research by Pinch Media (now Flurry) shows that free apps are used primarily in the first 10 days following installation, and then rapidly trail off to around 2% of the installation base after 70 days. Paid application usage drops off even more quickly.Mobile users prefer browsers over apps: A study by Keynote Systems in October 2010 shows that users prefer mobile websites for nearly all types of Web content. The only categories in which apps came out on top were social networking, music and games, which makes sense because these apps usually take full advantage of a native platform\u2019s capabilities.So, if we want to create something with more permanence, that can evolve at a speed that suits us and our clients, then we need to look away from mobile apps and towards the mobile Web. We must execute good design, thoughtful content and solid integration to tie our portable websites into the social infrastructure of the Web.ConclusionThe fully portable Web may not be here right now, but it will be before we know it. As it was with the browser wars, developers and designers must re-educate themselves to become the driving force behind these changes and be brave enough to let go of current design thinking and work to set new standards. Understanding how to create online presences that take full advantage of all platforms and preparing for the future shape of the Web will position us not just as technicians, but as people who can provide real value to our clients.ResourcesThe HTML5 editors and device emulators mentioned above can be downloaded from the following websites.HTML5 development environments:CS5 HTML5 Support Pack (part of the\u00a0CS5 11.0.3 Updater), plus\u00a0tutorialAptana 3 betaDevice emulators:AndroidOpera MiniApple iPhone (via iOS SDK)Windows Mobile (look for the latest Windows Phone Developer Tools)BlackBerryNokia Mobile Browser(al) (ik)Tweet James GardnerJames Gardner is a digital strategist working at Volume, one of the largest independent B2B digital marketing agencies in the UK.

I am currently studying webdesign and I always thought about scaling my sites down for mobile, but you\u2019re right. The other approach makes a lot more sense.Thanks! :) Reply 4-1 Lukigi March 29th, 2011 4:41 amGreat article! I reckon consistence is the key. Personally I don\u2019t like mobile versions. First think I do when I land on mobile version of a website is to look if I can switch to desktop version. Somehow I always have the feeling that content is limited and the experience I get is too different to the standard (Desktop) version I\u2019m used to.My personal take on this is that mobile devices are giving us better and better experience, faster connections, better quality screens, more processing power. Apple and Google both know that some content (often high quality) on internet will never be optimized for mobile, as it is made by people who are expert on their subjects but not necessarily on web design. And yes websites quality is going up, especially thanks to web templates but the progress is nowhere close to that of mobile devices.Make websites light, simple, flexible and standard friendly and let the mobile industry do the rest. Reply 50 Ivor March 29th, 2011 5:02 amJames, good article, however your information about silverlight is incorrect. Microsoft are not giving up on Silverlight, SL5 is just around the corner.

It would be a horrible user experience to find a website while viewing it from a laptop or desktop computer to be styled as a mobile site. Reply 110 Shane March 29th, 2011 6:50 am@Aaron, right on. And for similar reasons I disagree with: \u201cThe website\u2019s structure should be the same wherever it is viewed.\u201d The website\u2019s (and I\u2019m not sure that term is even applicable as internet appliances change the way they acquire content) structure should be adaptive to it\u2019s environment (e.g. device, bandwidth etc.). The content a user wishes to view on her phone will, in most cases, be largely different from what she is interested in seeing in the comforts of her home, or office where screen real-estate, bandwidth, and most likely time are more abundant.Great article, but I do take exception with this point. Reply 12+2 Billy March 29th, 2011 5:54 amIn your article you mentioned stay away from proprietary technology. I\u2019m a designer and I have yet to see a standard on the web. You further make the comment that you need to test test test. If the web was such an organized standard why would you need to test so much. In my opinion using Flash or other like technologies provides a consistent experience unlike the web standards we currently conform to. Think about how Acrobat has changed our lives. If we abandoned this proprietary software and went with a \u201cstandard\u201d would we be better off. Some may say yes, but I would say from a business perspective, No. This single application allows anybody to create rich interactive content (no coding) and share it with anybody and it remains consistent without regard for the browser or OS all you need is the plugin.

You think you have buggy and expensive software now. I equate that to the web standard. Think about it you have five major browsers and within each browsers multiple versions. Lets say there are five major browsers and five version within, that\u2019s 25 separate host applications that have to be accounted for.

Reply 130 Recep K\u00fct\u00fck March 29th, 2011 7:04 amI knew someone would heed the call and respond Vitaly\u2019s last article with a well-thought one. Thanks a lot James, you obviously took the extra mile and trouble to bring such detailed, informative and enlightening article together.The thing that bothers me about the \u201cportable web\u201d is that, when you are about to say something about it you have to be extra cautious and need to use words like \u201cas x as possible\u201d, \u201cwhenever feasible\u201d, \u201cwherever appropriate\u201d etc. That makes me feel like the subject is blurry, no room left for certain predictions. The fight to overcome browser inconsistencies was something, but another fight to explore and overcome the inconsistencies between devices? The very devices that are interacted with inconsistent conventions? I already feel exhausted, f this s.I could only find relief in one part of the article, the one that the user chooses \u201chouse\u201d over my \u201cdays-spent, well-put, cleverly planned, carefully detailed\u201d content. To be honest, I don\u2019t care if I lose this one..The situation now reminds me the fear I had when I had to give up good ole ie6 friendly table based designs and had to learn the magical world of standards and css. I hope I will be thinking how unnecessary my fear was and will be laughing at this very comment, in 3 years from now :)Thanks again James, you sure gave us something to (carefully) rant about!

I prefer VMs to my Mac\u2019s built-in server or servers like MAMP because you can run them only when you need them, pack them away when you\u2019re done, set up as many different ones as you need, and share them with friends and co-workers with ease. And if you\u2019re new to web server administration, setting up and maintaining a Linux VM is the perfect beginner project to practice your skills.In this article, we\u2019ll take a look at setting up a Linux virtual server with all the bits and pieces required to support a WordPress installation. If the words \u201cLinux\u201d, \u201cadminister\u201d, and \u201cserver\u201d give you the heebie-jeebies, you\u2019re in luck \u2014 we\u2019ll also show you how to use a pre-packaged WordPress server that takes just minutes to install and requires no knowledge of the command line. What\u2019s more, since we\u2019ll be making use of free and open source software, all it costs is a bit of your time and hard drive space!Download and Install VirtualBoxYour first step is to acquire a virtualisation system for your desktop machine. We\u2019ll be concentrating on VirtualBox, a free and open source virtualisation system for Windows, Mac, and Linux \u2014 you can grab it for free from the VirtualBox website.Those of you who have shelled out for another application, like VMWare Fusion or Parallels, never fear \u2014 you can still set up these VMs in the system you already have, but you\u2019ll need to consult your product\u2019s documentation for how to do this.Setting Up a Ubuntu Virtual MachineIf you\u2019re confident with the command line \u2014 or you\u2019d like to become confident \u2014 installing and configuring a VM from scratch might be the method for you. In late \u201909, Louis showed us how easy it is to build your own dev server with VirtualBox. The steps to do so here in 2011 are largely the same, so there\u2019s no need for us to repeat every step in this article \u2014 go ahead and check out that article for the full play-by-play. Before you do so, however, keep these three things in mind:In the article, Louis shows us how to set up port forwarding with an XML configuration file. In the latest version of VirtualBox, you can now also set up port forwarding in the VM\u2019s Network Adapter settings panel. You can see these settings in figures 1 and 2, below.During the installation process, the Ubuntu 10.10 Server installer will ask you to choose the type of system you\u2019d like to run. We\u2019re after a LAMP server and we\u2019d like to be able to log in using OpenSSH, so be sure to select that when asked. You can see this panel in figure 3, below:Doing so ensures that Apache, MySQL, PHP, and the OpenSSH packages are downloaded and installed from the outset.This process takes a while, and you\u2019ll need to set a few passwords and answer quite a few prompts \u2014 go brew up some tea or coffee, and pay close attention to every question, especially the ones that ask you for a password.If you followed Louis\u2019 instructions to the letter, and if all went well, you should now have a working Linux web server. Test this out by opening a web browser and heading over to http://localhost:8888. If you see a page that exclaims \u201cIt works!\u201d, you\u2019re on the right track.In your VM window, you should also be greeted by a login prompt. Log in now, using the admin username and password you chose when you installed Ubuntu.Grab WordPressWhile it\u2019s possible to install WordPress using Ubuntu\u2019s package manager, it\u2019s kind of idiosyncratic and fiddly. WordPress\u2019 famous five-minute install is called that for a reason, and it works perfectly, so let\u2019s install it this way, instead. First, head on over to the web directory, which should be /var/www:cd /var/www To grab the latest WordPress version, save yourself some tedious FTP-ing and have your VM download it direct with wget:wget http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz Now, unpack the zip:tar -zvxf latest.tar.gz All the WordPress files will be unpacked into a subdirectory of your website called wordpress. I\u2019d prefer my blog to live at the root directory of my website, so I\u2019ll be moving all these up one level:mv wordpress/* /var/www The default index.html file (that\u2019s the one that says \u201cIt works!\u201d) and empty wordpress directory can be removed:rm -r index.html wordpress Create A Database User and PasswordDuring the Ubuntu installation process, the wizard asked you to specify a \u201croot\u201d password for MySQL. You\u2019ll need that now, as we\u2019re about to create a database for WordPress to use. The process for doing so is explained over on the WordPress codex, and goes a little something like this:raena@wordpress:~$ mysql -u root -p Enter password: Welcome to the MySQL monitor. Commands end with ; or \\g. ... mysql> Now, you\u2019ll create the new database:mysql> CREATE DATABASE wordpress; Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec) Next, set up a database user:mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* -> TO \"wp_user\"@\"localhost\" -> IDENTIFIED BY \"password\"; Clean up after yourself, and you\u2019re done:mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES; mysql> EXIT Bye raena@wordpress:~$ Easy! You can now start installing WordPress using the web-based installer \u2014 head on over to http://localhost:8888 again and follow the instructions from the WordPress Codex.Setting Up A Pre-Packaged WordPress ApplianceIf you\u2019re less confident with the command line, or if you\u2019d prefer a simpler and faster installation process, a pre-packaged VM appliance might be the solution for you. A VM appliance is a virtual machine file that\u2019s already been installed and configured, with little or no need for adjustments on your part. WordPress\u2019 Codex suggests two appliances: BitNami\u2019s WordPress VM, and TurnKey Linux\u2019s WordPress Appliance. The TurnKey Linux VM is the most user-friendly, particularly for less confident Linux users, and it\u2019s the one we\u2019ll use for this example.First of all, you\u2019ll need to grab the appliance. TurnKey provides appliances in a number of different formats, one of which is the Open Virtualisation Format, or OVF. This is a common format for appliances, and bundles up all the software a VM needs in one easy-to-digest package. Look for the OVF link in the download bar, near the top of the TurnKey WordPress page.Once you have that file, simply open it in VirtualBox \u2014 you\u2019ll be asked to confirm the settings inside it. There should be little need to play with anything you find here, except perhaps the name of the virtual machine (vm is the default \u2014 a little generic, right?). VirtualBox will import the file and convert it into a virtual machine; when it\u2019s complete, you\u2019ll see it appear in the left of your VirtualBox window.Next, start the machine and keep an eye on the screen. You\u2019ll set up your machine through a wizard, which will ask you to set up usernames and passwords for the machine\u2019s root account, for MySQL, and for WordPress\u2019 administration account. You can see the wizard in action in figure 5, below:Be sure to make a note of these passwords. You\u2019ll also be asked to set up the TurnKey cloud backup service, daily security checks, and whether you\u2019d like to update your machine right away. It\u2019s fine to skip the TurnKey backup setup for the time being (you can always enable it later), but it\u2019s definitely important to set up your security updates now. It\u2019ll take a few minutes, so grab a cup of tea or coffee while your machine does its thing. When it\u2019s finished, you\u2019ll see the TurnKey configuration console, which tells you everything you need to know to reach your website and to administer it \u2014 check it out in the figure below. Your WordPress blog is installed and ready for action at the address specified under \u201cWeb\u201d, and you can administer your new server\u2019s other goodies using the command line or the easy Webmin interface. Double-check now that you can log in to your system and that the WordPress site is definitely installed.Since your appliance may have originally been created days or even weeks ago, you may find that you need to update some of your plugins, or even WordPress itself. Once you\u2019ve done that, though, you\u2019re ready to rumble!ConclusionNow that you\u2019re up and running, you\u2019re ready to fill your blog with interesting test content and start hacking on your plugins or themes. As with most things WordPress, the Codex is your best friend when it comes to tips, tricks, and troubleshooting advice \u2014 start with the Server and Database heading on the Advanced Topics page for some great information on what\u2019s going on under the hood there. Don\u2019t forget about the WordPress, Hosting and Apache sections of our forums, too! \u00ab Previous in Category Posted on March 29, 2011 in Web Tech and tagged as: sandbox, virtual machine, VM, wordpress. The views and opinions in this blog post are those of its author. This post has 2 responses so far Michael Why not just install a wamp, mamp-bundle - and thats it? You can still shut it off when you want. It just another 'famous five minutes install'... Reply Wolf_22 Because that's too easy, Michael. ;.) Using Vbox, you're likely to have a better tool set (I suppose it's debatable, especially considering that we're talking about Wordpress here and not some enterprise app). It's true, using WAMP is as easy as it comes, but what if you have to test for things like SSH or permission handling? Custom PHP.INI tweaks or HTTPD configs? I suppose these kinds of things could be synthesized using WAMP somehow, but not without a lot of meta development overhead. In all reality, the best way to do a sandbox isn't with Vbox nor WAMP, but instead, with an actual full-fledged server that has a 1-for-1 environment of your prod box. Of course, not everyone can do this, ap pro po, Vbox and WAMP. Either way, I've had Vbox slated on my to-do list for awhile now. Ironic how I now come across a great tutorial for it! Total win for moi'!

Like many people, I started blogging in small senior-level seminars. This was in 1999, and at the time there were not really blogging systems available, and like many other people, I had to write my own. What I saw as a very simple way to replace email lists and bulletin board (forum) systems turned out to be an extraordinarily effective way to encourage conversation among students, and I have used blogs in most of my classes in the years since. Today, blogging in a small class is a fairly easy way to get started for both students and teachers. How blogging can be used in large classes is not as immediately obvious. Many assume that once the class is large enough to exclude, for example, written term papers, it also means blogs are out. By that definition, a \"large class\" might be as few as thirty or forty students, depending on the composition of your university. My experience of using blogs in larger classes includes classes ranging in size from about fifty students to those that include nearly four hundred students.

(not case-sensitive) MIT Professor Daniel Nocera claims to have invented the first affordable solar cell capable of mimicking nature and performing photosynthesis -- splitting water.\u00a0\u00a0(Source: Christopher Harting/MIT) Another study examined how quantum dots may be able to perform \"Multiple Exciton Generation\" an unusual phenomena that sees an excited quantum dot electron (blue, left) transfer energy to multiple electrons in another quantum dot (green, right)\u00a0\u00a0(Source: Mark T. Lusk, Department of Physics, Colorado School of Mines) \"Her green plastic watering can/For her fake Chinese (silicon) plant/In the fake (silicon) earth.\" One of the most promising sources of future energy is solar power. \u00a0We're currently\u00a0only harvesting a minuscule fraction\u00a0of the estimated 12.2 billion kilowatt-hours of solar energy that hits the Earth every day [source]. \u00a0While\u00a0nuclear fission\u00a0and\u00a0fusion power\u00a0also will be critical to the future of man, solar power may be usable on planetoids that lack fissile fuels like uranium and fussile fuels like deuterium. Before we can get to such ambitious terrestrial or interplanetary objectives, much work needs to be done. \u00a0A pair of new studies published by the\u00a0Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u00a0and the Colorado School of Mines\u00a0offer intriguing tools that could one day be applied to making solar power more efficient. I. Growing a Solar \"Tree\" Scientists often find that nature has produced designs that rival any that mankind has cooked up. \u00a0A perfect example of that is the tree. \u00a0 A dominant plant species across much of the world, trees have solved much of the problems that have puzzled alternative energy scientists. \u00a0They not only store collected solar energy in polysaccharides, but also manage an immensely large solar collecting surface via their multipurpose evolutionary invention, the leaf. Using the chemical model of the leaf, researchers at MIT\u00a0created a poker-sized silicon cell, doped with special catalysts and controlling electronics. \u00a0The team reports that the device is capable of producing an abundantly positive energy balance by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. \u00a0The reactions it carries out are similar to those that occur inside chloroplasts in photosynthetic plant cells. The emitted gases could be harvested and stored for use powering a fuel cell. \u00a0Daniel Nocera, Ph.D. [profile], who led the team, describes [press release], \"A practical artificial leaf has been one of the Holy Grails of science for decades. We believe we have done it. The artificial leaf shows particular promise as an inexpensive source of electricity for homes of the poor in developing countries. Our goal is to make each home its own power station. \u00a0One can envision villages in India and Africa not long from now purchasing an affordable basic power system based on this technology.\" Professor Nocera reports that his leaf actually beats nature's design in efficiency by a factor of 10, and may be even more efficient in the future. \u00a0Of course it lacks natural leafy plants' ability to heal from damage, self-replicate, and self-generate from ground resources. \u00a0Nonetheless, the efficiency mark is an impressive achievement. The key to that success is special nickel-cobalt catalyst that Professor Nocera cooked up. \u00a0Much like photosynthetic pigments that use metal ions as their active center, these catalysts use the harvest solar energy to perform chemical reactions. John Turner of the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado created a similar \"solar leaf\" a decade ago, but it relied on expensive rare metal catalysts. \u00a0Since then, many other researchers have created new solar leaf designs, but most of their designs remained quite expensive or\u00a0lacked efficiency. By contrast Professor Nocera's design is far cheaper, while maintaining a respectable efficiency. The key obstacle now to this technology being practically suited for mass production is the lack of availability of cheap, durable fuel cells. \u00a0Currently fuel cells capable of producing enough energy to power a modern house remain quite expensive, costing tens, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars. \u00a0Still, it is reasonable to hope that similar breakthroughs will one day be able to drop the cost of fuel cells enough that the entire system will become feasible for mass deployment. MIT's research was funded by\u00a0The National Science Foundation\u00a0(NSF) and the\u00a0Chesonis Family Foundation. \u00a0It was presented at the\u00a0241st National Meeting of the American Chemical Society(ACS). II. Connecting the Quantum Dots Quantum dots\u00a0are outlandish human-constructed atoms that confine electrons to a three dimensional space in a crystal-like motif. \u00a0The electrons are capable of absorbing photons to form excitons and the properties of quantum dots themselves are somewhat like bulk semiconductors, making them an attractive target for photodetectors or solar cells. Scientists are still struggling to understand the complex structures they've created, though. \u00a0The dots operate on quantum physics rules far different from those observed on a macroscopic scale. New research at the Colorado School of Mines offers evidence in support of a controversial theory called multiple exciton generation (MEG), which suggests that a quantum dot's electron that has absorbed light energy from a single photon can transfer that energy to multiple other electrons. Previous studies have been remarkably inconsistent on the possible relationship between quantum dot size and MEG events, thus it was an attractive target for simulation, says the research team. \u00a0 Using a computer cluster funded by a NSF grant the team revealed that each size of quantum dot is capable of performing MEG for a select slice of the solar spectrum. \u00a0Smaller dots have the highest efficiency of electricity generation from their spectrum-dependent MEG events. The team's leader, Professor Mark Lusk [profile], says that the results indicate that using a mix of quantum dots could produce superior electricity generation capabilities in future solar cells. \u00a0He states [press release], \"We can now design nanostructured materials that generate more than one exciton from a single photon of light, putting to good use a large portion of the energy that would otherwise just heat up a solar cell.\" The results were published in a paper [abstract] in the peer-reviewed journal\u00a0ACS Nano.

That is where fuel cells start to come into play, they do the conversion much more effectively. Also don't worry there are a few new fuel cells that are in works for home use. They utilize the heat waste to heat house hold water tanks, and to power radiator style heat systems, when its cold. They also use it to create excess steam for self contained generators. So fuel cells are starting to come way down in cost, way up in safety, and very much so in efficiency.The leaf would probably last a very long time actually if blocked from harmful elements. I would envision them similar to solar panels, they do the same function basically just at a level / system a kin to nature, using low cost materials.Granted not as low cost as nature has managed, but still lower costs. Think about a house \"plant\" that set in a snow globe like bubble in the window that generated enough power to run your TV. Put a few in each room and you start to reduce your power costs greatly.Now do I see them being made into plant shaped items? not really, though who knows. LOL I do see them though as improved solar cells. Parent (2 Hidden) So It Takes the World's Smartest Scientists to Mimmick Something That Came About By Chance?

Give yourself another 2.7 to 3 billion years, and maybe it is reasonable that trees and other plants have managed to improve on photosynthesis to where they are today.

Even then, the \"modern\" plant that we all know and love today, with features like roots and leaves, looks to have started appearing around 370-380 million years ago (\"Middle of the Devonian period\").Note, all of this is from wikipedia, so if you don't trust that source, go to their primary sources instead to research for yourself.

Here's the (technical) steps I had to take in order to complete the migration while preserving the site's layout, usability and SEO characteristics. Note: I know that there are several other articles on the subject, however while I found many of them, I couldn't easily find answers to questions such as where to find something, what data is available with Jekyll when building the site, and so on. So in this post, while I describe what I have done to migrate my blog, I have also tried to make those answers readily available for others who may have the same issues as I had when migrating. It's a pretty long post, with a lot of information of the Wordpress => Jekyll migration, as well as on Jekyll in general, so I have organised the contents in various sections; if you are already familiar with Jekyll or are looking for a quick answer concerning something specific, feel free to jump to one section or another. Wordpress is a feature rich blogging platform that boosts a massive community and tons of extensions, so if you also have a blog powered by Wordpress but are unsure as to why you may want to migrate, have a look at my previous post, in which I mentioned the reasons why I decided to migrate anyway, and that Wordpress was not for me. Your mileage may vary, of course, but if in the end you do want to migrate to Jekyll, herein you will find useful tips that will hopefully save you some time. On a side note, while the focus here is clearly on the Wordpress => Jekyll migration, much of the information in this post can also be useful to users wanting to migrate from different blogging platforms, such as Blogger, Tumblr, Live Journal, and others. Contents: Introduction Installing and using Jekyll Configuration Importing from Wordpress Converting the imported posts to Markdown Layouts and includes Using static and dynamic data Liquid: some more useful stuff Comments Search engine optimisation - Creating an XML site map Syntax Highlighting Atom/RSS feed Extending Jekyll: plugins and extensions Contact form Conclusions Introduction Assuming you already are thinking of abandoning Wordpress for some reason, and are also thinking that Jekyll may be a good alternative for you, let's first have a brief look at how Jekyll differs from Wordpress, before looking at how to actually migrate. This may help you make an informed choice after all. To recap from the previous post, Jekyll: is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. This in short means that it isn't a CMS like Wordpress, it doesn't use a database, and all it does is basically generate a totally static site that can then be served directly by a web server like Nginx or Apache; if you have (hopefully) used a caching plugin with Wordpress such as WP-SuperCache, then you already know that this means a faster site; deployment is also easier, in that all you'd have to do to deploy a Jekyll site is copy it to your production web server (although you may prefer using something like Rsync, Capistrano or Rake, as we'll see later); since the site is fully static and is preprocessed in advance (as opposed to Wordpress with WP-SuperCache or similar where you still have dynamically built pages cached to static files), Jekyll does not need any server-side technologies (while for example Wordpress needs PHP), therefore no application server is required either; however, we'll see how \"mixing\" a fast static site generated by Jekyll with some server side technologies can still make sense in some cases; publishing or updating an article or page basically means you need to rebuild the entire static site - at least using Jekyll the typical way - and this may sound bad. Rebuilding the site is almost immediate for this blog, for example, since it's pretty new and doesn't have many posts yet; however it may take a considerable amount of time to rebuild a site with many more posts and pages. The three points above should carefully be taken into consideration when switching to Jekyll. For larger sites, it may be a case of better performance for the reader (Jekyll) vs faster publishing (Wordpress). Depending on whether you are or not a Ruby developer and are used or not to tools such as Git or other SCM, you may either prefer Wordpress' administration interface or using a developer's tools instead to publish your articles. This, again, is very important and you need to be sure you'll be happy with Jekyll's more \"manual\" approach. Personally, I do prefer editing my posts with TextMate, versioning with Git, and both publishing and maintaining the site with Rake and Capistrano tasks. It may sound like a more complex workflow, but in realty it can be simpler and a lot quicker once you are used to shortcuts of any type between your shell and your text editor of choice. However, since I bet many among the people who will end up reading this page are either non developers or are PHP developers who are used to different tools, it's your call whether all this suits your or not. Installing and using Jekyll For starters, in order to use Jekyll as your new publishing platform, you'll need to install it. Assuming you have a Ruby environment already configured, all you need for now is the jekyll gem: gem install jekyll Once you've got the gem installed, you'll need a folder which will contain the few files and folders Jekyll requires to work; at a minimum, Jekyll expects the following folder structure: -rw-r--r-- _config.yml drwxr-xr-x _includes drwxr-xr-x _layouts drwxr-xr-x _posts So just three folders and a configuration file. As we'll see later, my blog's folder has got a lot more stuff because of various extensions, plugins and more. But the items listed above are the basic files and folders Jekyll needs to work. You can also find a lot of Jekyll sites hosted on Github, so you could even fork one of them and start from there (at the moment I am using my own Git server for this blog, but I will also push the code to Github when I have time). _includes contains text files, typically HTML, that can be included like \"widgets\" in pages or layouts; if you are familiar with Ruby on Rails development, they are like partials in the context of Jekyll. _layouts, similarly, contains the layouts which can be used to give a consistent look to your pages - as in Wordpress, you can different layouts, for example with or without sidebars, or with different sets of includes (widgets in Wordpress). Jekyll uses Liquid as templating language. If you have never used it, it's basically a templating language with a designer friendly syntax, and can be extended if you know your way around Ruby - I'll show some examples on how to extend Liquid later on. _posts will contain text files written in Markdown (so with the .markdown extension) which represent -you guessed it- your actual posts. When you run the jekyll binary (installed together with the gem) to build the static site, Jekyll will process these text files through a Markdown filter (you can choose from a few filters available, as we'll see later) to convert them to posts in HTML. In a similar way, it will process \"raw\" pages through Liquid to generate the static, HTML pages that will then be served to clients (we'll see in greater detail later that not all the pages are processed with Liquid, depending on one particular condition). It is important to remember that Jekyll expects post files to have names in the format YYYY-MM-DD-title.markdown, since it uses the first part of a post's filename to determine the publishing date for the post. Unfortunately, Jekyll as is doesn't handle the time when a post was published, and this - as we'll see later - can cause a few issues although it can easily be fixed. _config.yml, the configuration file, is not really required, in that the settings it contains can also be specified at runtime as command line arguments for the jekyll command. I prefer keeping in _config.yml those options that I always want to have enabled, while I leave out options that I may want to use or not at runtime, depending on what I am doing; more details in the next section. Provided you already have some posts and have some layouts ready - we'll see later how to create both - it's extremely easy to generate the static site with Jekyll. All you have to do is run the jekyll command from within your blog's folder. Jekyll will then generate a static copy of your site, ready to be served to users with any web server, in a subfolder named _site. There are various deployment options which we'll see later, but in theory to deploy a Jekyll-generated site it's enough to copy the _site folder to the production web server, and that's it! Configuration As you may have guessed by the file's extension, the configuration is stored in YAML format, which you will certainly be familiar with if you are a Ruby developer. All the settings you can put in there are optional, since -as said- you could also specify the same options as command line arguments for the jekyll binary; the end result is the same (for example, if you wanted to run Jekyll and also start a server at the same time, you'd have to run jekyll --server). Here's my current configuration file: auto: false server: false lsi: false markdown: rdiscount pygments: true permalink: /:title paginate: 10 category_dir: topics category_title_prefix: exclude: [\"lib\", \"blog.rb\", \"Capfile\", \"config\", \"log\", \"Rakefile\", \"tmp\"] destination: public auto: if set to true, when you run the command jekyll it won't just build the static site and then exit; instead, it will run in foreground and monitor for changes in the posts or the other source files, and will automatically update the static site whenever changes occur; it can be useful for quick testing and debugging while your are either writing posts or making changes to the layouts, for example; server: if set to true, Jekyll will generate the static site and then start a server to serve the static site it has generated (the default is Webrick); it's not what you should use in production because of scalability issues, however it can be pretty useful in development; lsi: its value (true or false) determines how Jekyll will figure out related posts to associate to each of your posts. The default setting is false, meaning that Jekyll will do a sort of very quick calculation to determine related posts; this way building the static site is really fast, but the results are pretty poor. You can get more accurate related posts by setting this option to true; this way Jekyll will use Latent semantic indexing to find related posts, but it has the downside that the generation of the static site can take a ridiculously long time compared to the other option, so especially with large sites it may not be a good idea (well, depending on how important related posts are to you). I must say that this is one of the very few things I don't like about Jekyll so far; I used to use a great plugin for this in Wordpress, which yields much more accurate results -IMHO- and didn't really slow down things in a noticeable way; markdown: as anticipated, Jekyll allows you to use Markdown syntax when your write posts (although HTML is also allowed and correctly recognised in the files); this option lets you specify which Markdown filter Jekyll should use. I initially used Maruku since I like its extensions to the original Markdown syntax (it's a Markdown \"superset\"); however, unsurprisingly, I had to give up on it because of performance issues. Maruku is a pure Ruby Markdown interpreter, and as such it is very slow if compared to other alternatives. The fastest interpreter these days seems to be still Rdiscount, which is for the most part written in C. Unfortunately using Rdiscount means that you'll have to cope with a less featured Markdown syntax (and write some HTML by hand here and there), however the difference in terms of speed is massive, so big that even with a small site you'd be happy with the compromise (here's a benchmark done by somebody which will give you an idea of the difference); of course if you still prefer a richer Markdown superset, the choice is yours, however remember that the static site needs rebuilding each time its contents change, so speed is really an extremely important factor here. From my tests with Maruku, also, I've noticed that Maruku is a lot more sensible to syntax mistakes than Rdiscount is, in that it will very easily complain if the syntax is not 100% perfect, making editing a little annoying at times; pygments: Jekyll supports syntax highlighting out of the box (while Wordpress for example requires a plugin for this), though Pygments; the languages supported are pretty many and there's a lot of themes (basically, CSS styles) to choose from; permalink: in Wordpress, you have likely used a custom permalink structure to improve the SEO performance of your blog; of course, you can do this with Jekyll as well with this setting. Many people -me included- agree that the /:title permalink structure is best for SEO, however you need to choose wisely: ideally you should use exactly the same permalink structure you used to use with Wordpress, otherwise your blog's search engine rankings will be severely affected; you can of course change it whenever you want, but you must make sure your site instructs 301-permanent redirects from the old URLs to the new ones, in order to let search engines know in the correct way about the changes. Since Jekyll normally does not use a database nor a server side technology, this would only be possible if you have access to the web server's configuration for your site (which you don't, if you are using a third party's hosting service) and are familiar with that kind of configuration; another option is to \"mix\" the static site generated by Jekyll with some server side technology so to be able to instruct these redirects with server side code (we'll see later that I am using Sinatra together with Jekyll, although for other reasons); paginate: it lets you choose how many posts to show per page (Jekyll supports pagination); category_dir: similar to the same option in Wordpress to choose the root (in the URL) for your category pages; I have this setting because of an extension which I'll explain later; category_title_prefix: it allows you to prepend some text to page titles in category pages, such as \"Posts filed in ..\"; this setting is also there because of an extension; exclude: as you may have noticed earlier, the folders and files used by Jekyll to generate the static site have names that start with the underscore (\"_\"); this is because Jekyll recognises files and folders that contain files required for the generation of the static files, and will not copy them to the _site subfolder. So if you have files and folders that are required by Jekyll to generate the site or that you just need to keep in the site's root, but you don't want them to be available for download by clients, you have two options: the first is to give them names that start with the underscore; the second, when the first one is not possible or if you don't like that limit, is to set the exclude option to an array of names which will be then also ignored by Jekyll. We'll see later why I have added those names in my configuration file; destination: as mentioned earlier, by default Jekyll will generate the static site in the _site subfolder, but you can also customise its name. In my case, for example, I am using Capistrano for my deployment tasks, and since Capistrano expects the folders images, javascripts and stylesheets to be under the folder public, otherwise it will show warnings / throw errors, I have configured the destination option to let Jekyll know that I want the static site to be generated in the public subfolder instead. There may be other options available, but so far this is all I have needed so I haven't investigated further. Importing posts from Wordpress Perhaps the most important step among the first ones during the migration, is to import the posts you already have in your Wordpress blog, into Jekyll. Importing essentially means that you will need to read the relevant data from Wordpress' database and use it to dynamically create in the _posts folder as many text files as the number of posts you have. This, of course, unless you are willing to rewrite your posts in Jekyll... It doesn't really matter what you use to automate this process, as long as you can create the text files Jekyll expects from the data in your Wordpress database. If you, like me, work with Ruby, then Ruby will of course be the natural choice. Before migrating my posts, I saw on Jekyll's site that there was a reference script in Ruby, but it didn't cover some things I wanted to do so I wrote my own script; you could use it as it is or as a base for your own customised import process, but you need to make sure you have the required gems installed before proceeding. Here's why I used a different import script: I wanted to import more data, such as featured images for posts (introduced with Wordpress 3.0 if I remember rightly), categories, and tags; I wanted to import existing drafts and distinguish them from the published posts I wanted to convert the posts to Markdown while migrating; as said earlier, you can leave HTML in the Markdown files, but I didn't like the idea of having mixed HTML and Markdown posts in my _posts folder, plus I had to cleanup anyway the HTML generated by Wordpress and change things like the syntax highlighting code. You can find the full script in this gist on Github; here I'll highlight a few things in the code if you are familiar with Ruby. query = <<-EOS SELECT post_title, post_name, post_date, post_content, post_excerpt, ID, guid, post_status, post_type, post_status, ( SELECT guid FROM #{table_prefix}_posts WHERE ID = ( SELECT meta_value FROM #{table_prefix}_postmeta WHERE post_id = post.ID AND meta_key = \"_thumbnail_id\") ) AS post_image FROM #{table_prefix}_posts AS post WHERE post_type = 'post' EOS categories_and_tags_query = <<-EOS SELECT t.taxonomy, term.name, term.slug FROM xckmy_term_relationships AS tr INNER JOIN xckmy_term_taxonomy AS t ON t.term_taxonomy_id = tr.term_taxonomy_id INNER JOIN xckmy_terms AS term ON term.term_id = t.term_id WHERE tr.object_id = %d ORDER BY tr.term_order EOS As you can see, I have used two queries rather than a single query as seen in similar scripts for the importing. This is because as said I also wanted to import more data about posts, and I also wanted to import categories and tags as they were in Wordpress; I could have perhaps written a single query anyway, but since I didn't have many posts to import, it was easier to proceed this way rather than spending more time to figure out a proper join. ... status = post[:post_status] ... image = File.basename(post[:post_image]) rescue \"\" ... You can see here that I am also reading the featured image (if any), plus the status. This is because I then want to separate drafts from published posts (the sample script on Jekyll's site does not take drafts into account). `wget -O \"images/posts/featured/#{image}\" \"#{post[:post_image]}\"` unless File::exists?(\"images/posts/featured/#{image}\") || post[:post_image].nil? This may look ugly... I could have certainly copied the featured images directly from the other site, but since I had the URLs already in the database, it was quicker to just download the files with the proper name to the expected target destination. db[categories_and_tags_query % post[:ID]].each do |category_or_tag| eval(category_or_tag[:taxonomy].pluralize) << { \"title\" => category_or_tag[:name], \"slug\" => category_or_tag[:slug], \"autoslug\" => category_or_tag[:name].downcase.gsub(\" \", \"-\") } end Here's where I use the second query to import categories and tags (both referred to as \"taxonomies\" in Wordpress) for each post. The autoslug is perhaps something temporary as I haven't decided yet how to manage slugs and titles for categories and tags. In my Wordpress blog, these taxonomies had human friendly titles which often differ from their related slugs. So for the time being I am importing everything as is so not to affect SEO, although this means that I am basically storing -in posts- three values for each category or tag (title, slug, and autoslug). The autoslug is basically something that I am using for now for posts published after the migration, and it basically converts the human friendly title into a valid slug for use in URLs; the slug instead, if present, will have priority since it means that it was the slug used in the Wordpress blog. data = { 'layout' => 'post', 'title' => title.to_s, 'excerpt' => post[:post_excerpt].to_s, 'image' => image, 'wordpress_id' => post[:ID], 'wordpress_url' => post[:guid], 'categories' => categories, 'tags' => post_tags }.delete_if { |k,v| v.nil? || v == ''}.to_yaml Here you can see that I am also keeping the excerpts, and assign categories and tags to each post. In some other import scripts I have seen, others choose not to import the excerpts and to dynamically generate a \"read more\" intro by cutting the first N words from the post's content, but I do prefer having excerpts better thought for both usability and SEO. File.open(\"#{status == 'publish' ? '_posts' : '_drafts'}/#{name}\", \"w\") do |f| f.puts data f.puts \"---\" f.puts content end Finally, once collected and processed the relevant data, a text file for each post is created in either _posts or _drafts depending on whether it was a published post or still a draft. As mentioned previously, Jekyll expects these files to have names in the YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.markdown format; so it doesn't understand the time when a post was published, but only the date. Here's a warning: if you leave this as it is (instead of implementing a fix or workaround to preserve the original date and time each post was published), beware that this will affect the Atom/RSS feed that Jekyll will generate for your site, in that posts won't have a time associated to their published date, and therefore RSS readers and alike will treat all the old posts as new. So your feed's subscribers will likely see all the old entries once again in their RSS clients. I realised this after I had completed the migration. If you have many posts, you may want to think about this as it may annoy your readers. In the last code snippet, you can see that the YAML data generated from the relevant data for a post, is printed at the beginning of the file. This is called YAML Front Matter. Here's the front matter for my previous post, as an example: --- layout: \"post\" title: \"Migrating from Wordpress to Jekyll - Part 1: Why I gave up on Wordpress\" excerpt: \"Wordpress is a fully featured CMS that makes a great choice for blogging. However, after just three months, I decided Wordpress wasn't for me, and started to look for alternatives that would be easier for me to manage and customise as Ruby developer. Enter Jekyll. Here, in this first part, is why I don't think I will ever want to go back to a CMS like Wordpress.\" meta-description: \"Part one of a two-parts post on migrating my blog from Wordpress to Jekyll: the reasons\" image: \"jekyll.png\" tags: - slug: \"wordpress\" title: \"Wordpress\" autoslug: \"wordpress\" (cut) --- I have cut the other tags and all the categories to save space, since the concept should be clear. There's one thing I'd suggest you keep in mind when setting the properties: there are some characters you would need to escape when writing string values, or they will break the processing of the page. So it's just easier to enclose all text values in the front matter within double quotes, so then you know you only need to escape double quotes. So to import the existing posts from Wordpress, you can run the script as follows (in my case I had the script in the lib subfolder): ruby -r './lib/wordpress' -e 'WordPress::import(\"your wordpress db name\", \"db user\", \"db password\", \"table name prefix\")' Provided you have all the dependencies installed, and can access the Wordpress database with the credentials you have specified, after running the script you should have as many text files in the _posts and _drafts folders as the published posts and drafts you had in Wordpress. Converting the imported posts to Markdown This is something that you may want to do or not depending on your needs. In my case, I didn't like the idea of having new posts in Markdown, mixed to old posts - imported from Wordpress - in HTML. Plus, I also had to cleanup anyway the HTML imported from Wordpress and change things such as the syntax highlighting. So I decided I wanted to convert all the existing posts and drafts to Markdown as well, so to have all posts and drafts stored and managed in the same way. Luckily, I found a Ruby library, DownmarkIt, ready to use. Unfortunately I still had to apply minor fixes to the Markdown it generated... but all in all it worked quite well; so if you also want to convert Wordpress' posts to Markdown files, grab the library first and put it in the same folder as the import script. Then you'll have to make two small changes: first, you need to require the library; second, you'll need to make sure that each imported's post is first filtered through this library before being written to the destination text file: %w(rubygems sequel fileutils yaml active_support/inflector).each{|g| require g} require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), \"downmark_it\") ... db[query].each do |post| ... content = DownmarkIt.to_markdown post[:post_content] ... end ... That should be it. In my case the Markdown resulting from the conversion wasn't perfect (perhaps there are better alternatives, but I didn't want to invest more time on this), so I had to manually fix some little mistakes which would result in errors when parsing these Markdown files. But nothing really time consuming for me since I only had around twenty posts to check. Layouts and includes Once I had imported drafts and posts from my Wordpress blog, the next step naturally was to recreate the same layout and look in Jekyll. The very first attempt I made was basically to try to reuse the same stylesheets and scripts as in the old blog, and just copy and paste HTML from the blogs' pages (looking at their source) into new Liquid layouts, extracting here and there portions of HTML into includes. However there was a lot of clutter in the HTML produced by Wordpress or, more likely, the plugins I had; plus, the plugins were also the source of some mess with JavaScript and CSS Stylesheets, although I had already done some optimisations for the Wordpress blog. So in a word the operation didn't feel \"clean\", and I decided to restart from scratch with regards to layouts and includes, rewriting all the HTML. As already mentioned earlier, Jekyll uses Liquid to process layouts and includes, and luckily Liquid makes it easy and quick to recreate layouts, nested layouts, and includes in a way that looks similar to how partials work in Rails, so I really like this kind of organisation of the markup in several files. Jekyll will always parse with Liquid any file in the folders _posts, _includes and _layouts, by default. However Jekyll can also parse through Liquid any other file - regardless of its location - as long as the file contains, at the top, a YAML front matter; so if you want Jekyll to process a file with Liquid before the file gets copied to the static site (and that file is not a layout or include), you need to add a YAML front matter to that file. You don't have to add actual data to that YAML section; even an \"empty\" front matter will cause Jekyll to parse that file with Liquid anyway. Example: --- --- Here's the content of the page.... The interesting thing here is that any file with a front matter will be parsed with Liquid, and this is useful because it means that even CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files can be so processed, for example if you want to dynamically inject content or change something depending on the value of some variable, or things like these. Another cool thing is that with Liquid it is extremely easy to include some widget or anyway a portion of HTML into a layout, with the include directive: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> {% include head.html %} <body> ... </body> </html> head.html will be expected to exist in _includes. Of course, you can include the same file multiple times in the same or different layout or page, or even in another include for nesting. You can even have nested layouts with the same ease, and this is something I really like because it allows you to create a default layout, and then create variations with only the changes (for example a main layout with sidebars, and a layout without sidebars). Take the following layout, for example: --- layout: default --- This text will be nested into the parent layout named \"default\". For the nested layout to appear in the parent layout, you need to use the content directive in the parent layout, as shown below: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <body> This is the parent layout. Nested layout's content will appear below: {{ content }} </body> </html> The same applies to any page using a layout: you just need to specify a layout in the page's front matter, and make sure the layout has the content directive. I like Liquid because makes complex layouts extremely simple, since you can have just as many includes or nested layouts as you want. Using static and dynamic data We've already seen that we can add basically any kind of \"static\" data to a page or layout, by adding it to the YAML front matter. So for example say that we have a post file with this content: --- layout: post title: \"My gorgeous post\" --- Post content here.... We could have a layout named post (which has been specified in the post) like this: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <body> <h1>{{ title }}</h1> <p>{{ content }}</p> </body> </html> So you can use the {{ }} syntax for any of the static data you specify to the YAML front matter, too. This means that each post will have its title (as well as other data), that will be then rendered in the relevant layout. There's a lot more you can do with Liquid (and as we'll see you can even extend it); for more details, the official wiki is the best place to start with. I'll show more examples along the way. The \"static\" data you specify in the YAML front matter is not the only data you can use in your files. When you run the jekyll command to build the static site, Jekyll will automatically generate some hierarchical data on the posts, categories and so on that you can then use in any of the files that will be parsed with Liquid. Remember: you still need to add at least an empty YAML front matter to a file your want to be processed with Liquid, unless that file is in any of these folders: _posts, _includes, _layouts. For example, in your site's index page you will want to show the latest posts, right? So you can create an index.html file in the Jekyll folder with containing something like this: --- layout: default --- <h1>Latest entries</h1> {% for post in site.posts limit:4 %} <h2> <a href=\"/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent link to \">{{ post.title }}</a> </h2> <span>{{ post.date | date: '%B' }} {{ post.date | date: '%e' }}, {{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}</span> <p> {{ post.excerpt }} </p> {% endfor %} As you can see, in Liquid you can use loops as well; in the snippet above, you can also spot an example of Liquid functions to manipulate (in this case) dates. This is just a tiny example of course, but we'll see more of these (again, see Liquid's wiki for more info). The most important \"dynamic\" data Jekyll makes available when generating a site, that you can use in your files is as follows: site.categories, site.tags: returns all the categories / tags detected when processing the posts site.categories[page.category]: returns all the posts for the category of the current page; this can be useful when creating category pages, since it can be used to list all the posts for a particular category site.tags[page.tag], same as above, for tags post.categories, post.tags page.url, page.title, page.previous, page.previous.url, page.previous.title, page.next, page.next.url, page.next.title site.related_posts Once you know how to use both static and dynamic data, know which data is available to you, and know that you can also use loops and more in Liquid, you should now be able to build your own layouts, includes, etc. You may also want to search Github for same public Jekyll repositories and start your own blog from the source code of one of these, although I am afraid all the public examples I have seen are very basic. When I have a little time, I will publish the source code for this blog as well since it's a bit more complex than others so it covers more of what could or should be done with Jekyll. Liquid: some more useful stuff You already know about place holders to render data in layouts and pages, and have already seen loops. One thing that you may also happen to need is how to limit the items you want to iterate in a loop, or how to specify how many items you want to skip before iterating the remaining items. Have a look at my index page: as you can see I have 4 featured posts with a particular layout, followed by 6 \"teasers\", styled differently. To achieve this, my index.html page only contains this: {% include featured-posts.html %} {% assign teasers = site.posts %} {% assign teasers_skip = 4 %} {% assign teasers_take = 6 %} {% include post-teasers.html %} You've already seen include, so you know this means that the featured-posts.html file will be included in that place. But then there's something new: Liquid also lets you set variables that you can then use in your layouts and pages. This is particularly useful, because it allows you to reuse the same portion of Liquid layout but make it render differently depending on the values of some variables. So in my home page I first render the featured posts (we'll see in a minute what's in that include); then I assign all the site's posts to the variable named teasers, and in the following two steps I specify in two other variables that I want to skip the first 4 posts (since they will already be rendered as \"featured posts\"), and that I want to only take the next 6. Finally, the teasers.html include is injected. I use the same include in other layouts as well, but without limiting the number of posts to take or the number of posts to skip, so it's nice that I can just set variables and then use the same include in multiple places. Here's what I have in the featured-posts.html include (I have omitted the HTML for each posts since you already know how to render a post's data from the previous section): {% for post in site.posts limit:4 %} ... (featured post's content here) ... {% endfor %} You can see that I can limit the loop to the first 4 posts. And here's the content of the teasers.html include: {% for post in teasers offset:teasers_skip limit:teasers_take %} ... (teaser's content here) ... {% if forloop.last %} {% else %} {% cycle '', '<div class=teaser-separator></div>' %} {% endif %} {% endfor %} Where I say both how many posts to skip, and how many to take instead. In the snippet above you can also see something that may look weird. My home page renders teasers in two columns, so to achieve this I basically inject alternately, after each teaser, and empty string (so, nothing basically) or a div with the following CSS styles: .teaser-separator { clear: both; border-bottom: 1px solid #CCCCCC; } By adding that div with these styles, I force every odd teaser on the left, and every even teaser on the right. Luckily Liquid supports both the typical if..then..else construct, as well as the forloop.last and cycle methods, used the way shown above. Another thing useful to know is how to render links to the previous and next posts (if any). This is really good for SEO since it helps with internal linking. Below is the markup I am using at the moment, which should be pretty self explanatory. <div class=\"prev_next post_nav\"> {% if page.previous.url %} <p class=\"previous\"> \u00ab&nbsp;<a href=\"{{ page.previous.url }}/\" rel=\"previous\" title=\"{{ page.previous.title }}\">{{ page.previous.title | truncatewords: 15 }}</a> </p> {% endif %} {% if page.next.url %} <p class=\"next\"> <a href=\"{{ page.next.url }}/\" rel=\"next\" title=\"{{ page.next.title }}\">{{ page.next.title | truncatewords: 15 }}</a>&nbsp;\u00bb </p> {% endif %} </div> Next, here's is how I render related posts on my post pages (again, it should be pretty clear how it works, so I'll just paste it for reference): <div id=\"related-posts\"> <h3>You might also like</h3> <div> {% for related in site.related_posts limit:5 %} <div class=\"related-post\"> <div class=\"image\"> <img src=\"/images/posts/thumbnails/{{ related.image }}\"> </div> <div class=\"title\"> <a href=\"{{ related.url }}/\" target=\"_top\"> {{ related.title }} </a> </div> </div> {% endfor %} </div> </div> Important: if you use the --lsi option to get more accurate related posts (at the cost of a slower generation of the static site), you'll see that Jekyll suggests Notice: for 10x faster LSI support, please install http://rb-gsl.rubyforge.org/ So you could speed things up by just installing the gsl gem. However if you just try to install the gem, you may see errors since the gem requires a gsl package as well. On Mac OS X This is what I got at first on my Mac, which I use for the development: 551 $ gem install gsl Fetching: narray-0.5.9.9.gem (100%) Building native extensions. This could take a while... Fetching: gsl-1.14.7.gem (100%) Building native extensions. This could take a while...

This could take a while... Successfully installed gsl-1.14.7 1 gem installed Installing ri documentation for gsl-1.14.7... Installing RDoc documentation for gsl-1.14.7... Linux I got a similar error when I did the first setup for my new Jekyll blog on my production server, and the fix was also similar; here's what I had to install on Ubuntu 10.04 server: aptitude install libocamlgsl-ocaml-dev libgsl-ruby1.8 Once you got these dependencies sorted out, Jekyll should rebuild the site noticeably faster with the --lsi than before (it does for me). Lastly, I wanted to mention a few other Liquid directives I find useful to chain or transform data for rendering: {% capture post_url %}{{ page.url | prepend:'http://vitobotta.com' | append:'/' }}{% endcapture %} {% capture encoded_post_url %}{{ post_url | urlencode }}{% endcapture %} {% assign post_title = page.title %} {% capture encoded_post_title %}{{ post_title | urlencode }}{% endcapture %} {% capture encoded_post_image_url %}{{ page.image | prepend:'http://vitobotta.com/images/posts/featured/' | urlencode }}{% endcapture %} As you can see, it's pretty easy to chain data in Liquid with capture: all what is between capture's opening and closing tags is concatenated and assigned to the variable specified in the opening tag. You can also see here some more examples of Liquid functions to prepend, append, and replace text. Then there's the custom function urlencode; I'll show later how I extended Liquid with this function. All Liquid functions, as you can see, are used by appending a pipe to the data to transform, followed by the function's name and any arguments it may require. Comments One thing that should be pretty clear by now, is that because Jekyll only generates a static site, and it doesn't use a database nor any dynamic content built with server side technologies, it doesn't support comments out of the box. There are two possibilities to fix that: either you can use some server side technology and integrate the management of comments into Jekyll's static pages in a way or another, or - the recommended one - you can just outsource comments. Services like Disqus, Intense Debate and similar have become pretty popular these days and are great for comments since they offer a much better experience even compared to that you'd normally have with Wordpress; even with Wordpress you could improve the built in comments feature with plugins, but that often means a heavier Wordpress install, and generally speaking it's hard to achieve this way the same user experience that those third party services offer with minimum effort. Even Facebook have recently revamped their comments plugin and it's now pretty good, so much so that even some large sites have started to use it. However I prefer Disqus over it (I have never liked Intense Debate too much), because of both its nice integration of what they call social media reactions, and the fact that they allow users to login with multiple authentication providers, as opposed to Facebook that at the moment - I think - only supports authentication with Facebook credentials. Regardless of which one you choose, there's a few things you should know if you aren't yet familiar with outsourcing a blog's comments to a separate service: since comments are -obviously- stored elsewhere, they will be loaded into your pages through a JavaScript remote call; it is very easy to integrate a third party commenting service since it only requires you to add some JavaScript code snippet to your layouts, but this also means that comments won't be already present in the page while the page loads and is rendered, so comments may appear more slowly or not at all in the event the service you use is down; the fact that comments are not present in the HTML documents of your pages, means that those comments basically \"don't exist\" for search engines. Search engines, in fact, will only index the HTML of your pages, not JavaScript code nor JSON data that is loaded from the remote service to render your comments in the client's browser; so this may be a negative point with regards to SEO depending on your point of view; some people think that comments may distract from the focus on the topic of a page (in the context of SEO), so perhaps it is better that they are excluded or ignored when search engines' spiders index the site; other people instead think that the content of comments may also help drive search traffic to the site; if you think that comments add to the SEO of your site, it's good to know that some services -like Disqus- create a comments page on their site for each page of your site that implements comments, and their pages basically instruct search engines of the canonical location of the comments, that is your own pages. So in theory this should fix some of the SEO related issues, and your site should be able to claim back some precious link juice; while all these services usually require you to include just one script into your layouts, when comments are actually loaded these service make a number pretty high of additional HTTP requests to load whatever is needed to render the comments in your pages; this can indeed affect the general client side performance of your site so you should also take it into consideration because a) users may perceive slowness, b) search engines now also take into account client side speed in the algorithms that calculate rankings; most of these external commenting services, when used with Wordpress through plugins, also take care of the synchronisation of all the comments between your Wordpress install and their own data store; this means that a) you will always have a local \"backup\" of all your comments, although they are managed by an external service; b) that if the commenting service is down at some time, you can temporarily switch it off and restore Wordpress' built in commenting until the problem is fixed so your readers would have a limited user experience but the commenting feature wouldn't be completely lost. This is something that of course is not possible with Jekyll out of the box since Jekyll doesn't have even a database. However nothing forbids you to do a local backup of all the comments every so often; most of these services (if not all), in fact, also offer APIs that you can use to download and synchronise comments with a local database, although this of course requires that you are familiar with some programming language. I am planning to do something like this in Ruby ASAP (unless there's something ready for the purpose - I haven't investigated this yet), and will then post about it when done; if you have always used Wordpress' built in commenting feature, you will have all your comments in your Wordpress database, therefore you will need to import all those comments into Disqus or other service before the same comments can be available for your Jekyll site. In my case I didn't need to do this as I have always used Disqus since the beginning (so Disqus already had all my comments when I migrated), but if you need to, the easiest way is to install Disqus' plugin in your Wordpress blog and let it synchronise all the comments to Disqus' servers; this may take anywhere from a few minutes to hours or days depending on how many comments you blog has. So, how do you integrate one of these services in your Jekyll blog? I'll show here how easy it is with Disqus, so far my favourite. You can get the necessary info from your Disqus account, however here's what I had to do as an example and for quicker reference. First, I created the file _includes/comments.html, making sure it contains a div element with id set to disqus_thread, since Disqus will render the comments in this element; then I specified the id of my blog in Disqus (which is vitosjournal) and the URL to use as the association between some comments and the page where those comments should appear. You can see I used a simple Liquid placeholder with the page.url that Jekyll makes available for each of your pages. Finally, I have included Disqus' script: <div id=\"comments\"> <h3>Have your say!</h3> <p> Please see my <a href=\"/comment-policy/\">comment policy</a> if this is your first time here or if you have any questions regarding comments. </p> <div id=\"disqus_thread\"></div> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> var disqus_shortname = 'vitosjournal'; var disqus_url = \"http://vitobotta.com/how-to-migrate-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/\"; /* * * DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE * * */ (function() { var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true; dsq.src = 'http://' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js'; (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=\"http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript\">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> <a href=\"http://disqus.com\" class=\"dsq-brlink\">blog comments powered by <span class=\"logo-disqus\">Disqus</span></a> </div> You can obtain a snippet similar to the one above from within your Disqus account (following Install => Universal Code). That's it: you should now see the comments rendered correctly in your pages. A second step was to get the View comments link next to each featured post or teaser (in the index or in the archive pages), to display the number of comments (and, for Disqus, of social media reactions) stored for each of them. You can achieve this by making sure that a) you add another script which will take care of this: (function () { var s = document.createElement('script'); s.async = true; s.type = 'text/javascript'; s.src = 'http://' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/count.js'; (document.getElementsByTagName('HEAD')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('BODY')[0]).appendChild(s); }()); b) each link to comments has a URL ending with the #disqus_thread fragment identifier; Jekyll will recognise these links and, by default, use the URL in the link's href attribute as unique identifier for the comments count to display: ... <span class=\"comments-link\"><a href=\"http://vitobotta.com/#disqus_thread\" rel=\"nofollow\">View Comments</a></span> ... You can optionally add an attribute named data-disqus-identifier if you want to specify a different URL or use some different piece of information as unique identifier for your comments. A word of warning: make sure that if you specify the data-disqus-identifier, the identifier is the correct one and Disqus correctly recognises it. In my case this didn't work despite I had just taken the same identifiers I could see from my Wordpress blog (I was using Disqus' plugin already); however I haven't had any issues whatsoever using the normal URLs instead. That's all for comments if you go for Disqus, but the process should be pretty similar with the other services too. Search engine optimisation - Creating an XML site map Worpress is not bad from a SEO point of view already out of the box, and you -like me- may have further improved its SEO performance with a SEO-oriented theme (mine was Thesis) and various plugins. With Jekyll, you need to care yourself of anything SEO, as well. At least for the basics, here's what I did: I first created an include, meta-tags.html, containing (among other things) these meta tags: ... <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"{{ page.meta-robots }}\" /> <meta name=\"description\" content=\"{{ page.meta-description }}\" /> ... Then, in each page's or post's YAML front matter, I added the relevant information. Here's, for example, the full content of my index.hml: --- layout: \"default\" title: \"Tips and walkthroughs on web technologies and digital life \u2013 Vito\u2019s journal\" meta-description: \"Vito Botta\u2019s tech blog with tips and walkthroughs on web technologies and digital life. Main topics covered are web development with free and open source tools (such as Linux, Ruby, Rails, MySQL), performance & scalability, computer security, database, search engine optimisation (SEO). Vito is a passionate web developer living and working in London, UK. His roles as analyst, developer and technology enthusiast overlap here on his web log.\" meta-robots: \"noodp, noydir\" --- {% include featured-posts.html %} {% assign teasers = site.posts %} {% assign teasers_skip = 4 %} {% assign teasers_take = 6 %} {% include post-teasers.html %} <div id=\"view-all-entries\"> <a href=\"/sitemap/\">View all the entries</a> </div> As you can see, besides the title (recommended max length: 65-70 characters) and the meta description (recommended max length: ~150 characters), I also specify for each page how search engine's robots should treat it. The possible values of the meta-robots setting: noodp: instructs search engines to not generate descriptive snippets from the Open Directory Project as a source - as this may yield unexpected results; noydir: same as above, but with regards to Yahoo! Directory; noindex: tells spiders to basically ignore the current page; noarchive: tells spiders not to cache/archive the contents of the current page; I suggest you search these settings if you aren't familiar with them; I basically have noodp and noydir for all my pages, while on pages that I want to be ignored by search engines, I also add noindex and noarchive. This way, I can make sure search engines only have relevant information on my posts rather than duplicate content or information that would only look like clutter in the context of a search. Besides meta-tags.html, I also have another include, link-rel.html, which contains links to stylesheets but also a link tag for canonical URLs: ... <link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"{{ page.url | canonical }}\" /> ... As you can see, I am using the custom Liquid function canonical (we'll see later how you can define custom functions), to adapt the page URL in some way. Please ignore that function for now since it's something a bit more specific to my blog, the important thing is that you put in there the correct canonical URL for each page (in the YAML front matter, of course, so that include can be added to all the layouts with just a Liquid placeholder). Canonical URLs are required to avoid issues with duplicate content in a number of cases, since duplicate content may affect the SEO performance of a site. In my Wordpress blog, canonical URLs were very important since I often had very long posts (such as the one you are reading) that -because of the length- I had split in several sections, that is on different pages basically. In that case, by having a canonical URL pointing to the first page of a long article, for all its pages, would ensure that search engines would push ranking for the first page rather than diluting the SEO value of the article across its pages. In reality, even with this kind of configuration there may still be problems with search engines. In fact, in Google's Matt Cutts' words: A canonical page is the preferred version of a set of pages with highly similar content. Also: Must the content on a set of pages be similar to the content on the canonical version? Yes. The rel=\"canonical\" attribute should be used only to specify the preferred version of many pages with identical content (although minor differences, such as sort order, are okay). So Google makes it pretty clear that canonical URLs help avoid issues with duplicate content that may penalise the ranking of your pages, but the content on each of the pages pointing to the same canonical URL must have identical (or almost identical) content. This isn't the case of course with the content of a post split into different pages, so I had to change my plans with regards to in-post pagination and I would suggest you do the same if you also come from a similar Wordpress setup. Besides SEO, I have received enough feedback from readers to understand they don't usually like to have to load different pages just to read the entire content of an article. It's a slower reading experience for them and they may think you do this just to increase the number of page views, although you may instead do this simply to organise longer posts. So, it looks like I had enough reasons to drop in-post pagination altogether. Now, long posts on this blog (such as the one you are reading) are still organised in sections, but it's actually just a single, long page with in-page hyperlinks. User experience should now be improved, and the site should be in safer water also for what concerns SEO. Back to the canonical URLs: I am still using them, despite I no longer split long posts into multiple pages, ad again I would suggest you do the same. Why? It is just safer in case you happen to have the same identical (or very similar) content on more than one page, but not only. Do you -like me- use a CDN? If yes, you may be surprised to hear that depending on the CDN you use, and on how you use it, the CDN may affect the SEO performance of your site! Try a site:your-cdn-hostname.com search in Google, and check for yourself if you have CDN-cached copies of your pages and posts that directly compete (as for SEO) with your site! If yes, you clearly have a duplicate content issue there. Make sure that your CDN allows you to specify a custom robots.txt for your CDN distribution that will remain as you define it regardless of the content of your site's own robots.txt. So for example in the root of my CDN distribution I have a robots.txt file with the following content: User-agent: * Disallow: / This tells spider to completely ignore the content of the whole CDN distribution (or \"pull zone\" if you are using a service similar to the one I use, MaxCDN). Instead, the robots.txt in the actual site that I do want spiders to index, contains: User-agent: * Disallow: Sitemap: http://vitobotta.com/sitemap.xml This allows spiders to index the whole site without restrictions instead. You can also see that I am specifying the location of my site's XML sitemap. In Wordpress, you have likely -hopefully- used a plugin to create this site map that you could then let Google know about (optionally also through the Google Webmaster Tools). It is a recommended task, since the XML site map helps Google understand the content you care about, and you can even tell it (as well as the other search engines I suppose) the priority with which it should index your pages and posts. You can easily have a fully functional XML site map with Jekyll too, by simply creating a sitemap.xml file in the root of your Jekyll folder. Here's the content of mine: --- --- <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <?xml-stylesheet type=\"text/xsl\" href=\"/sitemap.xsl\"?> <urlset xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9 http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9/sitemap.xsd\" xmlns=\"http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9\"> <url> <loc>http://vitobotta.com/</loc> <lastmod>{{ site.time | date_to_xmlschema }}</lastmod> <changefreq>daily</changefreq> <priority>1.0</priority> </url> <url> <loc>http://vitobotta.com/cv-resume/</loc> <lastmod>2011-02-07T20:59:36+00:00</lastmod> <changefreq>weekly</changefreq> <priority>0.6</priority> </url> {% for post in site.posts limit:20 %} <url> <loc>http://vitobotta.com{{ post.url }}/</loc> <lastmod>{{ post.date | date_to_xmlschema }}</lastmod> <changefreq>weekly</changefreq> <priority>0.8</priority> </url> {% endfor %} </urlset> You can see that I have specified only my Ruby CV page (you may want search engines to index other pages as well), and all the posts, assigning a higher priority to posts and asking search engines to come back to check for changes every day (this is only an indication of the frequency, you can't really decide). You can also see that I have added an empty YAML front matter to ensure the file is processed with Liquid when Jekyll rebuilds the static site. Sometimes I check that the site map is as expected after making changes to the site, by loading it directly in my browser. Since the file will be plain XML in the end, I have specified an XSL stylesheet so to make it appear it more user friendly when displayed in a browser. You can find my sitemap.xsl file in this gist if you want to do the same. Syntax Highlighting One of the nice things that Jekyll can handle out of the box (while in Wordpress you'll need a plugin), is syntax highlighting. As mentioned in the Configuration section, Jekyll uses Pygments for this; all you need to do is to turn the feature on, by either setting pygments to true in your _config.yml or as command line argument when you run jekyll to rebuild the static site. It's very easy to let Jekyll know you want to render a portion of text in your posts, as code: ... some Markdown or HTML... ... {% highlight html %} YOUR CODE HERE {% endhighlight %} ... Besides HTML, Pygments supports a long list of languages. One optional thing that you should do is generate the CSS stylesheet for the theme you choose to use with Pygments. In my case, I didn't like too much the (many) themes available by default, and I went instead for a Railscasts inspired theme which I like much more. First, I had to install the new theme so that Pygments would recognise it: git clone git://github.com/DrMegahertz/pygments-style-railscasts.git cd /Users/vito/Documents/Code/OpenSource/pygments-style-railscasts ./setup.py install Then, to check that all went well, I started Python's console and entered the commands you see below: python >>> from pygments.formatters import HtmlFormatter >>> HtmlFormatter(style='railscasts').style <class 'pygments_style_railscasts.RailscastsStyle'> If you see that class returned, all is well. You can now export the correct styles to a new CSS stylesheet that you'll then have to include in your layouts: pygmentize -S railscasts -f html > railscasts.css Atom/RSS feed Similarly to what we've seen for the XML sitemap, when you switch from Wordpress to Jekyll you'll also have to remember that the Atom / RSS feed for your blog won't be automatically generated and updated for you. However, it's as easy to have a feed with Jekyll as it is to have an XML site map. Just create a file with the same name and location of the feed in your Wordpress blog (usually /feed/index.html), and paste the code below into it: --- --- <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <feed xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"> <title type=\"text\" xml:lang=\"en\">Vito's journal</title> <link type=\"application/atom+xml\" href=\"http://vitobotta.com/feed/\" rel=\"self\"/> <link type=\"text\" href=\"http://vitobotta.com\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <updated>{{ site.time | date_to_xmlschema }}</updated> <id>http://vitobotta.com</id> <author> <name>Vito Botta</name> </author> <rights>Copyright (c) 2010-2011 Vito Botta</rights> {% for post in site.posts limit:20 %} <entry> <title></title> <link href=\"http://vitobotta.com{{ post.url }}/\"/> <updated>{{ post.date | date_to_xmlschema }}</updated> <id>http://vitobotta.com{{ post.url }}/</id> <summary type=\"html\">{{ post.excerpt | xml_escape }}</summary> </entry> {% endfor %} </feed> That's it. Jekyll will keep this file updated whenever you publish new posts and clients will know about them. Remember, however, that Jekyll doesn't handle the time when posts are published, and this may cause your readers to see old posts coming back as soon as they hit your new feed for the first time (as mentioned earlier). In my case I realised this after I had already migrated, so it was late. If you want, it's not difficult to fix: just add the time to the YAML front matter of each post, and then add a Liquid place holder for it in the feed template you see above. This should work, although I haven't tested it. Extending Jekyll: plugins and extensions One of the most interesting characteristics of Jekyll is that - provided you know your way around Ruby - you have full power on what it can do in three ways. First, the most obvious one: you can just fork the code and make whichever changes you like, and then use your version of the gem rather than the original one. However, while this is easy, I prefer the other two options, plugins and extensions, since they let me achieve the same without having to change Jekyll's code. There are two main advantages with this: you can update Jekyll's gem whenever there's a new version, without having to mess with the code because of the changes you had made on the previous version; both plugins and extensions live in code files that you can easily share across projects. Plugins Jekyll expects your plugins to live in the _plugins folder. So far I have needed plugins for two particular needs: to make Jekyll generate custom page types that it wouldn't generate otherwise; for example, think of the archive pages (category pages, tag pages, monthly archives and so on), since Jekyll -surprisingly IMHO- doesn't generate them by default despite it understands categories, tags, etc; to register new, custom Liquid tags that can be used to pull in whatever content you want, in any place of your layouts, with just a single placeholder as we have seen for content, for example. Archive pages I was lucky enough to find some useful examples of plugins here; I basically took the plugin to generate category pages and customised it slightly since -as you may remember- each category in my site has multiple properties (slug, title and autoslug) vs a single text value. Then I created other plugins from that one to generate tag pages and monthly archives. Besides these, I have also created a couple of other plugins: Tag cloud The first custom plugin I wrote lets me register the custom Liquid tag tag_cloud. If used as we've seen for other placeholders, ... {{ tag_cloud }} ... it will render ... you guessed it.. a tag cloud. Here's the code of the plugin: module Jekyll class TagCloud < Liquid::Tag safe = true def render(context) tags = context.registers[:site].tags.map{|tag| { \"title\" => tag[0][\"title\"], \"slug\" => tag[0][\"slug\"], \"autoslug\" => tag[0][\"autoslug\"], \"posts\" => tag[1] } } min_count = tags.min{|a, b| a[\"posts\"].length <=> b[\"posts\"].length }[\"posts\"].length max_count = tags.max{|a, b| a[\"posts\"].length <=> b[\"posts\"].length }[\"posts\"].length weights = tags.inject({}){|result, tag| result[tag[\"title\"]] = ( ((tag[\"posts\"].length - min_count) * (280 - 75)) / (max_count - min_count) ) + 75; result } tags.inject(\"\") { |html, tag| html << \"<span style='font-size: #{sprintf(\"%d\", weights[tag['title']])}%'><a href='/tags/#{tag['slug'] || tag['autoslug']}/'>#{tag[\"title\"]}</a></span>\\n\" html } end end end Liquid::Template.register_tag('tag_cloud', Jekyll::TagCloud) As you can see it's different from the other plugins in that it only registers the Liquid tag but it doesn't create any files. If you're curious how I calculate the \"weight\" for each tag depending on the number of posts associated to it, I am now using a formula I found here after some googling. Speeding up syntax highlighting Another very useful plugin I was glad to have found, helps speed up the syntax highlighting. I found it here. It basically caches code that has already been processed with Pygments to files in the _cache folder, so next time Jekyll has to rebuild the static site it won't have to reprocess the syntax highlighting for code snippets that are already cached and haven't changed (the plugin checks the MD5 hash of each code snippet). Since I don't have many posts yet, perhaps it doesn't make much difference for me, but since Pygments can be quite slow -I think- with large code snippets, I can see how it may help speed things up on larger blogs with lots of code snippets. Extensions Plugins aren't the only way to extend Jekyll without touching its code. I found here about a Ruby gem named jekyll_ext that lets you achieve similar results but in a slightly different way. Extensions are expected to live in _extensions, and work by changing or adding features through filters, thanks to meta programming - see this for more details. At the moment I am using a single extension, and over the past few days I have realised that plugins are kind of the \"official\" way of extending Jekyll, so perhaps it may be pointless to use both plugins and extensions; however at the moment I am happy with my setup so I haven't experimented for example with converting the single extension I currently have into a plugin. There is one reason though I may anyway look into using just plugins in the future, in that to make extensions work you need to generate the static site by running the wrapper ejekyll (installed together with the jekyll_ext gem), rather than jekyll. It's just one more thing to remember perhaps, but this makes plugins a little cleaner as a solution for extending Jekyll, besides that they are baked into it already. Here's the code for that extension: require \"active_support\" require \"cgi\" require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), \"../config/environment\") module Jekyll module Filters def urlencode(input) CGI::escape(input) end def canonical(input) \"http://vitobotta.com/#{ input.sub(/\\/index\\.html$/, \"\") }/\".gsub(/\\/\\//, \"/\") end end AOP.around(Site, :site_payload) do |site, args, proceed, abort| result = proceed.call topics = site.categories.map{|topic| { \"title\" => topic[0][\"title\"], \"slug\" => topic[0][\"slug\"], \"autoslug\" => topic[0][\"autoslug\"], \"posts\" => topic[1] } }.sort{|a,b| b[\"posts\"].size <=> a[\"posts\"].size } archives = site.posts.inject(ActiveSupport::OrderedHash.new) do |archives, post| year, month, day = post.date.year, post.date.month, post.date.day archives[year] ||= ActiveSupport::OrderedHash.new archives[year][month] ||= ActiveSupport::OrderedHash[\"title\", Date::MONTHNAMES[month], \"days\", ActiveSupport::OrderedHash.new, \"post_count\", 0, \"slug\", month.to_s.rjust(2,'0')] archives[year][month][\"post_count\"] += 1 archives[year][month][\"days\"][day] ||= [] archives[year][month][\"days\"][day] << post archives end result[\"site\"][\"topics\"] = topics result[\"site\"][\"archives\"] = archives result[\"site\"][\"static\"] = STATIC_LOCATION result end end Basically it helps me with two things: it registers the custom Liquid functions canonical and urlencode which we've seen earlier it creates an hierarchical data set with the posts organised by year, month, day, that I can use in my pages. It's just the way I am using the data at the moment, so there may be better alternatives, but for me it works. Contact form Besides comments, another typical feature of a blog that is basically lost when switching to Jekyll because of the lack of both a database and a server side technology, is that of a contact form. You could outsource a contact form too, however for added privacy I have preferred adding the support for dynamic content to my static Jekyll blog, through Sinatra. Jekyll generates a completely static site, so it is a no brainer to integrate the two things; also, besides the contact form I may need some dynamic action for something else too in the future, so it's useful to have Sinatra available while the normal blog is still a super fast static site. Integrating Sinatra is pretty easy: Sinatra expects all static content that should be ready to be served to clients in the public folder. As mentioned in the configuration section, Jekyll by default generates the static site in _site, but it is easy to change this by setting the option destination in the _config.yml configuration file. You could change the location of Sinatra's public folder instead, but since -as we'll see in the next section- having Sinatra makes Capistrano a natural choice for deployment, and because Capistrano expects the folders images, stylesheets and javascripts to be in public, it's just easier to change the destination option in Jekyll instead. Back to the contact form... there are surely various ways of doing this, but at the moment what I do is have an iframe in the contact page that renders the actual contact form, dynamically rendered by Sinatra. Nobody likes iframes, but for the time being it'll do. Conclusions As you can easily guess, this post took me ages to write, but I wanted to write a useful and up to date reference on how to migrate to Jekyll and how to use it, since I am very happy so far with it and I bet an increasing number of people will prefer its approach over Wordpress and other heavier solutions. I think I have covered pretty much all that is needed for anyone from getting started to Jekyll to basically do most things with it, but I am sure there is more to say on the subject. I'll leave it here for now, but I am already thinking of a couple more posts on Jekyll that I am sure many will find useful; in particular, a more in depth look at various deployment options (besides just copying the static site, as mentioned), how to integrate a simple Sinatra-powered contact form, and some maintenance tips. So keep on eye on this blog if you are interested in knowing more about these topics. In the meantime, I hope you'll find in this post the information you were looking for, and if you have questions, suggestions or any thoughts, don't be shy and let me know in the comments.

In this second part, we\u2019ll continue developing the application by adding extra functionality. In doing this, you\u2019ll be introduced to some important and powerful features of the Android SDK, including Persistent data storage, Activities and Intent as well as Shared user preferences.To follow this tutorial, you\u2019ll need the code from the previous article. If you want to get started right away, grab the code from GitHub and check out the tutorial_part_1 tag using this: $ git clone git://github.com/cblunt/BrewClock.git $ cd BrewClock $ git checkout tutorial_part_1 Once you\u2019ve checked out the code on GitHub, you\u2019ll need to import the project into Eclipse:Launch Eclipse and choose File \u2192 Import\u2026In the Import window, select \u201cExisting Projects into Workspace\u201d and click \u201cNext.\u201dOn the next screen, click \u201cBrowse,\u201d and select the project folder that you cloned from GitHub.Click \u201cFinish\u201d to import your project into Eclipse.After importing the project into Eclipse, you might receive a warning message: Android required .class compatibility set to 5.0. Please fix project properties. If this is the case, right-click on the newly imported \u201cBrewClock\u201d project in the \u201cProject Explorer,\u201d choose \u201cFix Project Properties,\u201d and then restart Eclipse.Getting Started With Data StorageCurrently, BrewClock lets users set a specific time for brewing their favorite cups of tea. This is great, but what if they regularly drink a variety of teas, each with their own different brewing times? At the moment, users have to remember brewing times for all their favorite teas! This doesn\u2019t make for a great user experience. So, in this tutorial we\u2019ll develop functionality to let users store brewing times for their favorite teas and then choose from that list of teas when they make a brew.To do this, we\u2019ll take advantage of Android\u2019s rich data-storage API. Android offers several ways to store data, two of which we\u2019ll cover in this article. The first, more powerful option, uses the SQLite database engine to store data for our application.SQLite is a popular and lightweight SQL database engine that saves data in a single file. It is often used in desktop and embedded applications, where running a client-server SQL engine (such as MySQL or PostgreSQL) isn\u2019t feasible.Every application installed on an Android device can save and use any number of SQLite database files (subject to storage capacity), which the system will manage automatically. An application\u2019s databases are private and so cannot be accessed by any other applications. (Data can be shared through the ContentProvider class, but we won\u2019t cover content providers in this tutorial.) Database files persist when the application is upgraded and are deleted when the application is uninstalled.We\u2019ll use a simple SQLite database in BrewClock to maintain a list of teas and their appropriate brewing times. Here\u2019s an overview of how our database schema will look: +-------------------------------------+ | Table: teas | +------------+------------------------+ | Column | Description | +------------+------------------------+ | _ID | integer, autoincrement | | name | text, not null | | brew_time | integer, not null | +------------+------------------------+ If you\u2019ve worked with SQL before, this should look fairly familiar. The database table has three columns: a unique identifier (_ID), name and brewing time. We\u2019ll use the APIs provided by Android to create the database table in our code. The system will take care of creating the database file in the right location for our application.Abstracting the DatabaseTo ensure the database code is easy to maintain, we\u2019ll abstract all the code for handling database creation, inserts and queries into a separate class, TeaData. This should be fairly familiar if you\u2019re used to the model-view-controller approach. All the database code is kept in a separate class from our BrewClockActivity. The Activity can then just instantiate a new TeaData instance (which will connect to the database) and do what it needs to do. Working in this way enables us to easily change the database in one place without having to change anything in any other parts of our application that deal with the database.Create a new class called TeaData in the BrewClock project by going to File \u2192 New \u2192 Class. Ensure that TeaData extends the android.database.sqlite.SQLiteOpenHelper class and that you check the box for \u201cConstructors from superclass.\u201dThe TeaData class will automatically handle the creation and versioning of a SQLite database for your application. We\u2019ll also add methods to give other parts of our code an interface to the database.Add two constants to TeaData to store the name and version of the database, the table\u2019s name and the names of columns in that table. We\u2019ll use the Android-provided constant BaseColumns._ID for the table\u2019s unique id column: // src/com/example/brewclock/TeaData.java import android.app.Activity; import android.content.ContentValues; import android.content.Context; import android.database.Cursor; import android.database.DatabaseUtils; import android.provider.BaseColumns; public class TeaData extends SQLiteOpenHelper { private static final String DATABASE_NAME = \"teas.db\"; private static final int DATABASE_VERSION = 1; public static final String TABLE_NAME = \"teas\"; public static final String _ID = BaseColumns._ID; public static final String NAME = \"name\"; public static final String BREW_TIME = \"brew_time\"; // \u2026 } Add a constructor to TeaData that calls its parent method, supplying our database name and version. Android will automatically handle opening the database (and creating it if it does not exist). // src/com/example/brewclock/TeaData.java public TeaData(Context context) { super(context, DATABASE_NAME, null, DATABASE_VERSION); } We\u2019ll need to override the onCreate method to execute a string of SQL commands that create the database table for our tea. Android will handle this method for us, calling onCreate when the database file is first created.On subsequent launches, Android checks the version of the database against the DATABASE_VERSION number we supplied to the constructor. If the version has changed, Android will call the onUpgrade method, which is where you would write any code to modify the database structure. In this tutorial, we\u2019ll just ask Android to drop and recreate the database.So, add the following code to onCreate: // src/com/example/brewclock/TeaData.java @Override public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase db) { // CREATE TABLE teas (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT NOT NULL, brew_time INTEGER); String sql = \"CREATE TABLE \" + TABLE_NAME + \" (\" + _ID + \" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, \" + NAME + \" TEXT NOT NULL, \" + BREW_TIME + \" INTEGER\" + \");\"; db.execSQL(sql); } @Override public void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) { db.execSQL(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS \" + TABLE_NAME); onCreate(db); } Next, we\u2019ll add a new method to TeaData that lets us easily add new tea records to the database. We\u2019ll supply the method with a name and brewing time for the tea to be added. Rather than forcing us to write out the raw SQL to do this, Android supplies a set of classes for inserting records into the database. First, we create a set of ContentValues, pushing the relevant values into that set.With an instance of ContentValues, we simply supply the column name and the value to insert. Android takes care of creating and running the appropriate SQL. Using Android\u2019s database classes ensures that the writes are safe, and if the data storage mechanism changes in a future Android release, our code will still work.Add a new method, insert(), to the TeaData class: // src/com/example/brewclock/TeaData.java public void insert(String name, int brewTime) { SQLiteDatabase db = getWritableDatabase(); ContentValues values = new ContentValues(); values.put(NAME, name); values.put(BREW_TIME, brewTime); db.insertOrThrow(TABLE_NAME, null, values); } Retrieving DataWith the ability to save data into the database, we\u2019ll also need a way to get it back out. Android provides the Cursor interface for doing just this. A Cursor represents the results of running a SQL query against the database, and it maintains a pointer to one row within that result set. This pointer can be moved forwards and backwards through the results, returning the values from each column. It can help to visualize this: SQL Query: SELECT * from teas LIMIT 3; +-----------------------------------+ | _ID | name | brew_time | +-----------------------------------+ | 1 | Earl Grey | 3 | | 2 | Green | 1 | <= Cursor | 3 | Assam | 5 | +-------+-------------+-------------+ In this example, the Cursor is pointing at the second row in the result set (Green tea). We could move the Cursor back a row to represent the first row (Earl Grey) by calling cursor.moveToPrevious(), or move forward to the Assam row with moveToNext(). To fetch the name of the tea that the Cursor is pointing out, we would call cursor.getString(1), where 1 is the column index of the column we wish to retrieve (note that the index is zero-based, so column 0 is the first column, 1 the second column and so on).Now that you know about Cursors, add a method that creates a Cursor object that returns all the teas in our database. Add an all method to TeaData: // src/com/example/brewclock/TeaData.java public Cursor all(Activity activity) { String[] from = { _ID, NAME, BREW_TIME }; String order = NAME; SQLiteDatabase db = getReadableDatabase(); Cursor cursor = db.query(TABLE_NAME, from, null, null, null, null, order); activity.startManagingCursor(cursor); return cursor; } Let\u2019s go over this method in detail, because it looks a little strange at first. Again, rather than writing raw SQL to query the database, we make use of Android\u2019s database interface methods.First, we need to tell Android which columns from our database we\u2019re interested in. To do this, we create an array of strings\u2014each one of the column identifiers that we defined at the top of TeaData. We\u2019ll also set the column that we want to order the results by and store it in the order string.Next, we create a read-only connection to the database using getReadableDatabase(), and with that connection, we tell Android to run a query using the query() method. The query() method takes a set of parameters that Android internally converts into a SQL query. Again, Android\u2019s abstraction layer ensures that our application code will likely continue to work, even if the underlying data storage changes in a future version of Android.Because we just want to return every tea in the database, we don\u2019t apply any joins, filters or groups (i.e. WHERE, JOIN, and GROUP BY clauses in SQL) to the method. The from and order variables tell the query what columns to return on the database and the order in which they are retrieved. We use the SQLiteDatabase.query() method as an interface to the database.Last, we ask the supplied Activity (in this case, our BrewClockActivity) to manage the Cursor. Usually, a Cursor must be manually refreshed to reload any new data, so if we added a new tea to our database, we would have to remember to refresh our Cursor. Instead, Android can take care of this for us, recreating the results whenever the Activity is suspended and resumed, by calling startManagingCursor().Finally, we\u2019ll add another utility method to return the number of records in the table. Once again, Android provides a handy utility to do this for us in the DatabaseUtils class:Add the following method, count, to your TeaData class: // src/com/example/brewclock/TeaData.java public long count() { SQLiteDatabase db = getReadableDatabase(); return DatabaseUtils.queryNumEntries(db, TABLE_NAME); } Save the TeaData class, and fix any missing imports using Eclipse (Source \u2192 Organize Imports). With our data class finished, it\u2019s time to change BrewClock\u2019s interface to make use of the database!Modify BrewClock\u2019s Interface to Allow Tea SelectionThe purpose of storing preset teas and brew times is to let the user quickly select their favorite tea from the presets. To facilitate this, we\u2019ll add a Spinner (analogous to a pop-up menu in desktop interfaces) to the main BrewClock interface, populated with the list of teas from TeaData.As in the previous tutorial, use Eclipse\u2019s layout editor to add the Spinner to BrewClock\u2019s main interface layout XML file. Add the following code just below the LinearLayout for the brew count label (around line 24). Remember, you can switch to the \u201cCode View\u201d tab along the bottom of the window if Eclipse opens the visual layout editor. <!-- /res/layout/main.xml --> <!-- Tea Selection --> <LinearLayout android:orientation=\"vertical\" android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\" android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"> <Spinner android:id=\"@+id/tea_spinner\" android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\" android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\" /> </LinearLayout> In the BrewClockActivity class, add a member variable to reference the Spinner, and connect it to the interface using findViewById: // src/com/example/brewclock/BrewClockActivity.java protected Spinner teaSpinner; protected TeaData teaData; // \u2026 public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { // \u2026 teaData = new TeaData(this); teaSpinner = (Spinner) findViewById(R.id.tea_spinner); } Try running your application to make sure the new interface works correctly. You should see a blank pop-up menu (or Spinner) just below the brew count. If you tap the spinner, Android handles displaying a pop-up menu so that you can choose an option for the spinner. At the moment, the menu is empty, so we\u2019ll remedy that by binding the Spinner to our tea database.Data BindingWhen Android retrieves data from a database, it returns a Cursor object. The Cursor represents a set of results from the database and can be moved through the results to retrieve values. We can easily bind these results to a view (in this case, the Spinner) using a set of classes provided by Android called \u201cAdapters.\u201d Adapters do all the hard work of fetching database results from a Cursor and displaying them in the interface.Remember that our TeaData.all() method already returns a Cursor populated with the contents of our teas table. Using that Cursor, all we need to do is create a SimpleCursorAdapter to bind its data to our teaSpinner, and Android will take care of populating the spinner\u2019s options.Connect the Cursor returned by teaData.all() to the Spinner by creating a SimpleCursorAdapter: // com/example/brewclock/BrewClockActivity.java public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { // \u2026 Cursor cursor = teaData.all(this); SimpleCursorAdapter teaCursorAdapter = new SimpleCursorAdapter( this, android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item, cursor, new String[] { TeaData.NAME }, new int[] { android.R.id.text1 } ); teaSpinner.setAdapter(teaCursorAdapter); teaCursorAdapter.setDropDownViewResource(android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item); } Notice that we\u2019ve made use of Android\u2019s built-in android.R object. This provides some generic default resources for your application, such as simple views and layouts. In this case, we\u2019ve used android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item, which is a simple text label layout.If you run the application again, you\u2019ll see that the spinner is still empty! Even though we\u2019ve connected the spinner to our database, there are no records in the database to display.Let\u2019s give the user a choice of teas by adding some default records to the database in BrewClock\u2019s constructor. To avoid duplicate entries, we\u2019ll add only the default teas if the database is empty. We can make use of TeaData\u2019s count() method to check if this is the case.Add code to create a default set of teas if the database is empty. Add this line just above the code to fetch the teas from teaData: // com/example/brewclock/BrewClockActivity.java public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { // \u2026 // Add some default tea data! (Adjust to your preference :) if(teaData.count() == 0) { teaData.insert(\"Earl Grey\", 3); teaData.insert(\"Assam\", 3); teaData.insert(\"Jasmine Green\", 1); teaData.insert(\"Darjeeling\", 2); } // Code from the previous step: Cursor cursor = teaData.all(this); // \u2026 } Now run the application again. You\u2019ll now see that your tea Spinner has the first tea selected. Tapping on the Spinner lets you select one of the teas from your database!Congratulations! You\u2019ve successfully connected your interface to a data source. This is one of the most important aspects of any software application. As you\u2019ve seen, Android makes this task fairly easy, but it is extremely powerful. Using cursors and adapters, you can take virtually any data source (from a simple array of strings to a complex relational database query) and bind it to any type of view: a spinner, a list view or even an iTunes-like cover-flow gallery!Although now would be a good time for a brew, our work isn\u2019t over yet. While you can choose different teas from the Spinner, making a selection doesn\u2019t do anything. We need to find out which tea the user has selected and update the brew time accordingly.Read Selected Tea, and Update Brew TimeTo determine which tea the user has selected from our database, BrewClockActivity needs to listen for an event. Similar to the OnClickListener event that is triggered by button presses, we\u2019ll implement the OnItemSelectedListener. Events in this listener are triggered when the user makes a selection from a view, such as our Spinner.Enable the onItemSelectedListener in BrewClockActivity by adding it to the class declaration. Remember to implement the interface methods onItemSelected() and onNothingSelected(): // src/com/example/brewclock/BrewClockActivity.java public class BrewClockActivity extends Activity implements OnClickListener, OnItemSelectedListener { // \u2026 public void onItemSelected(AdapterView<?> spinner, View view, int position, long id) { if(spinner == teaSpinner) { // Update the brew time with the selected tea\u2019s brewtime Cursor cursor = (Cursor) spinner.getSelectedItem(); setBrewTime(cursor.getInt(2)); } } public void onNothingSelected(AdapterView<?> adapterView) { // Do nothing } } Here we check whether the spinner that triggered the onItemSelected event was BrewClock\u2019s teaSpinner. If so, we retrieve a Cursor object that represents the selected record. This is all handled for us by the SimpleCursorAdapter that connects teaData to the Spinner. Android knows which query populates the Spinner and which item the user has selected. It uses these to return the single row from the database, representing the user\u2019s selected tea.Cursor\u2019s getInt() method takes the index of the column we want to retrieve. Remember that when we built our Cursor in teaData.all(), the columns we read were _ID, NAME and BREW_TIME. Assuming we chose Jasmine tea in teaSpinner, the Cursor returned by our selection would be pointing at that record in the database.We then ask the Cursor to retrieve the value from column 2 (using getInt(2)), which in this query is our BREW_TIME column. This value is supplied to our existing setBrewTime() method, which updates the interface to show the selected tea\u2019s brewing time.Finally, we need to tell the teaSpinner that BrewClockActivity is listening for OnItemSelected events. Add the following line to BrewClockActivity\u2019s onCreate method: // src/com/example/brewclock/BrewClockActivity.java public void onCreate() { // \u2026 teaSpinner.setOnItemSelectedListener(this); } That should do it! Run your application again, and try selecting different teas from the Spinner. Each time you select a tea, its brew time will be shown on the countdown clock. The rest of our code already handles counting down from the current brew time, so we now have a fully working brew timer, with a list of preset teas.You can, of course, go back into the code and add more preset teas to the database to suit your tastes. But what if we released BrewClock to the market? Every time someone wanted to add a new tea to the database, we\u2019d need to manually update the database, and republish the application; everyone would need to update, and everybody would have the same list of teas. That sounds pretty inflexible, and a lot of work for us!It would be much better if the user had some way to add their own teas and preferences to the database. We\u2019ll tackle that next\u2026Introducing ActivitiesEach screen in your application and its associated code is an Activity. Every time you go from one screen to another, Android creates a new Activity. In reality, although an application may comprise any number of screens/activities, Android treats them as separate entities. Activities work together to form a cohesive experience because Android lets you easily pass data between them.In this final section, you\u2019ll add a new Activity (AddTeaActivity) to your application and register it with the Android system. You\u2019ll then pass data from the original BrewClockActivity to this new Activity.First, though, we need to give the user a way to switch to the new Activity. We\u2019ll do this using an options menu.Options MenusOptions menus are the pop-up menus that appear when the user hits the \u201cMenu\u201d key on their device. Android handles the creation and display of options menus automatically; you just need to tell it what options to display and what to do when an option is chosen by the user.However, rather than hard-coding our labels into the menu itself, we\u2019ll make use of Android string resources. String resources let you maintain all the human-readable strings and labels for your application in one file, calling them within your code. This means there\u2019s only one place in your code where you need to change strings in the future.In the project explorer, navigate to \u201cres/values\u201d and you will see that a strings.xml file already exists. This was created by Eclipse when we first created the project, and it is used to store any strings of text that we want to use throughout the application.Open strings.xml by double clicking on it, and switch to the XML view by clicking the strings.xml tab along the bottom of the window.Add the following line within the <resources>\u2026</resources> element: <!-- res/values/strings.xml --> <resources> <!-- \u2026 --> <string name=\"add_tea_label\">Add Tea</string> </resources> Here you\u2019ve defined a string, add_tea_label, and its associated text. We can use add_tea_label to reference the string throughout the application\u2019s code. If the label needs to change for some reason in the future, you\u2019ll need to change it only once in this file.Next, let\u2019s create a new file to define our options menu. Just like strings and layouts, menus are defined in an XML file, so we\u2019ll start by creating a new XML file in Eclipse:Create a new Android XML file in Eclipse by choosing File \u2192 New \u2192 Other, and then select \u201cAndroid XML File.\u201dSelect a resource type of \u201cMenu,\u201d and save the file as main.xml. Eclipse will automatically create a folder, res/menu, where your menu XML files will be stored.Open the res/menus/main.xml file, and switch to XML view by clicking the \u201cmain.xml\u201d tab along the bottom of the window.Add a new menu item, add_tea. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <menu xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"> <item android:id=\"@+id/add_tea\" android:title=\"@string/add_tea_label\" /> </menu> Notice the android:title attribute is set to @string/add_tea_label. This tells Android to look up add_tea_label in our strings.xml file and return the associated label. In this case, our menu item will have a label \u201cAdd Tea.\u201dNext, we\u2019ll tell our Activity to display the options menu when the user hits the \u201cMenu\u201d key on their device.Back in BrewClockActivity.java, override the onCreateOptionsMenu method to tell Android to load our menu when the user presses the \u201cMenu\u201d button: // src/com/example/brewclock/BrewClockActivity.java @Override public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) { MenuInflater inflater = getMenuInflater(); inflater.inflate(R.menu.main, menu); return true; } When the user presses the \u201cMenu\u201d button on their device, Android will now call onCreateOptionsMenu. In this method, we create a MenuInflater, which loads a menu resource from your application\u2019s package. Just like the buttons and text fields that make up your application\u2019s layout, the main.xml resource is available via the global R object, so we use that to supply the MenuInflater with our menu resource.To test the menu, save and run the application in the Android emulator. While it\u2019s running, press the \u201cMenu\u201d button, and you\u2019ll see the options menu pop up with an \u201cAdd Tea\u201d option.If you tap the \u201cAdd Tea\u201d option, Android automatically detects the tap and closes the menu. In the background, Android will notify the application that the option was tapped.Handling Menu TapsWhen the user taps the \u201cAdd Tea\u201d menu option, we want to display a new Activity so that they can enter the details of the tea to be added. Start by creating that new Activity by selecting File \u2192 New \u2192 Class.Name the new class AddTeaActivity, and make sure it inherits from the android.app.Activity class. It should also be in the com.example.brewclock package: // src/com/example/brewclock/AddTeaActivity.java package com.example.brewclock; import android.app.Activity; import android.os.Bundle; public class AddTeaActivity extends Activity { @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); } } This simple, blank Activity won\u2019t do anything yet, but it gives us enough to finish our options menu.Add the onOptionsItemSelected override method to BrewClockActivity. This is the method that Android calls when you tap on a MenuItem (notice it receives the tapped MenuItem in the item parameter): // src/com/example/brewclock/BrewClockActivity.java @Override public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) { switch(item.getItemId()) { case R.id.add_tea: Intent intent = new Intent(this, AddTeaActivity.class); startActivity(intent); return true; default: return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item); } } With this code, we\u2019ve told Android that when the \u201cAdd Tea\u201d menu item is tapped, we want to start a new Activity; in this case, AddTeaActivity. However, rather than directly creating an instance of AddTeaActivity, notice that we\u2019ve used an Intent. Intents are a powerful feature of the Android framework: they bind Activities together to make up an application and allow data to be passed between them.Intents even let your application take advantage of any Activities within other applications that the user has installed. For example, when the user asks to display a picture from a gallery, Android automatically displays a dialogue to the user allowing them to pick the application that displays the image. Any applications that are registered to handle image display will be shown in the dialogue.Intents are a powerful and complex topic, so it\u2019s worth reading about them in detail in the official Android SDK documentation.Let\u2019s try running our application to test out the new \u201cAdd Tea\u201d screen.Run your project, tap the \u201cMenu\u201d button and then tap \u201cAdd Tea.\u201dInstead of seeing your \u201cAdd Tea\u201d Activity as expected, you\u2019ll be presented with a dialogue that is all too common for Android developers:Although we created the Intent and told it to start our AddTeaActivity Activity, the application crashed because we haven\u2019t yet registered it within Android. The system doesn\u2019t know where to find the Activity we\u2019re trying to run (remember that Intents can start Activities from any application installed on the device). Let\u2019s remedy this by registering our Activity within the application manifest file.Open your application\u2019s manifest file, AndroidManifest.xml in Eclipse, and switch to the code view by selecting the \u201cAndroidManifest.xml\u201d tab along the bottom of the window.The application\u2019s manifest file is where you define global settings and information about your application. You\u2019ll see that it already declares .BrewClockActivity as the Activity to run when the application is launched.Within <application>, add a new <activity> node to describe the \u201cAdd Tea\u201d Activity. Use the same add_tea_label string that we declared earlier in strings.xml for the Activity\u2019s title: <!-- AndroidManifest.xml --> <application \u2026> \u2026 <activity android:name=\".AddTeaActivity\" android:label=\"@string/add_tea_label\" /> </application> Save the manifest file before running BrewClock again. This time, when you open the menu and tap \u201cAdd Tea,\u201d Android will start the AddTeaActivity. Hit the \u201cBack\u201d button to go back to the main screen.With the Activities hooked together, it\u2019s time to build an interface for adding tea!Building The Tea Editor InterfaceBuilding the interface to add a tea is very similar to how we built the main BrewClock interface in the previous tutorial. Start by creating a new layout file, and then add the appropriate XML, as below.Alternatively, you could use Android\u2019s recently improved layout editor in Eclipse to build a suitable interface. Create a new XML file in which to define the layout. Go to File \u2192 New, then select \u201cAndroid XML File,\u201d and select a \u201cLayout\u201d type. Name the file add_tea.xml.Replace the contents of add_tea.xml with the following layout: <!-- res/layouts/add_tea.xml --> <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <LinearLayout xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\" android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\" android:layout_height=\"fill_parent\" android:orientation=\"vertical\" android:padding=\"10dip\"> <TextView android:text=\"@string/tea_name_label\" android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\" android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\" /> <EditText android:id=\"@+id/tea_name\" android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\" android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"/> <TextView android:text=\"@string/brew_time_label\" android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\" android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"/> <SeekBar android:id=\"@+id/brew_time_seekbar\" android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\" android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\" android:progress=\"2\" android:max=\"9\" /> <TextView android:id=\"@+id/brew_time_value\" android:text=\"3 m\" android:textSize=\"20dip\" android:layout_width=\"fill_parent\" android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\" android:gravity=\"center_horizontal\" /> </LinearLayout> We\u2019ll also need to add some new strings to strings.xml for the labels used in this interface: <!-- res/values/strings.xml --> <resources> <!-- \u2026 --> <string name=\"tea_name_label\">Tea Name</string> <string name=\"brew_time_label\">Brew Time</string> </resources> In this layout, we\u2019ve added a new type of interface widget, the SeekBar. This lets the user easily specify a brew time by dragging a thumb from left to right. The range of values that the SeekBar produces always runs from zero (0) to the value of android:max.In this interface, we\u2019ve used a scale of 0 to 9, which we will map to brew times of 1 to 10 minutes (brewing for 0 minutes would be a waste of good tea!). First, though, we need to make sure that AddTeaActivity loads our new interface:Add the following line of code to the Activity\u2019s onCreate() method that loads and displays the add_tea layout file: // src/com/example/brewclock/AddTeaActivity.java public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.add_tea); } Now test your application by running it, pressing the \u201cMenu\u201d button and tapping \u201cAdd Tea\u201d from the menu.You\u2019ll see your new interface on the \u201cAdd Tea\u201d screen. You can enter text and slide the SeekBar left and right. But as you\u2019d expect, nothing works yet because we haven\u2019t hooked up any code.Declare some properties in AddTeaActivity to reference our interface elements: // src/com/example/brewclock/AddTeaActivity.java public class AddTeaActivity { // \u2026 /** Properties **/ protected EditText teaName; protected SeekBar brewTimeSeekBar; protected TextView brewTimeLabel; // \u2026 Next, connect those properties to your interface: public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { // \u2026 // Connect interface elements to properties teaName = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.tea_name); brewTimeSeekBar = (SeekBar) findViewById(R.id.brew_time_seekbar); brewTimeLabel = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.brew_time_value); } The interface is fairly simple, and the only events we need to listen for are changes to the SeekBar. When the user moves the SeekBar thumb left or right, our application will need to read the new value and update the label below with the selected brew time. We\u2019ll use a Listener to detect when the SeekBar is changed:Add an onSeekBarChangedListener interface to the AddTeaActivity class declaration, and add the required methods: // src/com/example/brewclock/AddTeaActivity.java public class AddTeaActivity extends Activity implements OnSeekBarChangeListener { // \u2026 public void onProgressChanged(SeekBar seekBar, int progress, boolean fromUser) { // TODO Detect change in progress } public void onStartTrackingTouch(SeekBar seekBar) {} public void onStopTrackingTouch(SeekBar seekBar) {} } The only event we\u2019re interested in is onProgressChanged, so we need to add the code below to that method to update the brew time label with the selected value. Remember that our SeekBar values range from 0 to 9, so we\u2019ll add 1 to the supplied value so that it makes more sense to the user:Add the following code to onProgressChanged() in AddTeaActivity.java: // src/com/example/brewclock/AddTeaActivity.java public void onProgressChanged(SeekBar seekBar, int progress, boolean fromUser) { if(seekBar == brewTimeSeekBar) { // Update the brew time label with the chosen value. brewTimeLabel.setText((progress + 1) + \" m\"); } } Set the SeekBar\u2019s listener to be our AddTeaActivity in onCreate: // src/com/example/brewclock/AddTeaActivity.java public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { // \u2026 // Setup Listeners brewTimeSeekBar.setOnSeekBarChangeListener(this); } Now when run the application and slide the SeekBar left to right, the brew time label will be updated with the correct value:Saving TeaWith a working interface for adding teas, all that\u2019s left is to give the user the option to save their new tea to the database. We\u2019ll also add a little validation to the interface so that the user cannot save an empty tea to the database!Start by opening strings.xml in the editor and adding some new labels for our application: <!-- res/values/strings.xml --> <string name=\"save_tea_label\">Save Tea</string> <string name=\"invalid_tea_title\">Tea could not be saved.</string> <string name=\"invalid_tea_no_name\">Enter a name for your tea.</string> Just like before, we\u2019ll need to create a new options menu for AddTeaActivity so that the user can save their favorite tea:Create a new XML file, add_tea.xml, in the res/menus folder by choosing File \u2192 New and then Other \u2192 Android XML File. Remember to select \u201cMenu\u201d as the resource type.Add an item to the new menu for saving the tea: <!-- res/menus/add_tea.xml --> <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <menu xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"> <item android:title=\"@string/save_tea_label\" android:id=\"@+id/save_tea\" /> </menu> Back in AddTeaActivity, add the override methods for onCreateOptionsMenu and onOptionsItemSelected, just like you did in BrewClockActivity. However, this time, you\u2019ll supply the add_tea.xml resource file to the MenuInflater: // src/com/example/brewclock/AddTeaActivity.java @Override public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) { MenuInflater inflater = getMenuInflater(); inflater.inflate(R.menu.add_tea, menu); return true; } @Override public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) { switch(item.getItemId()) { case R.id.save_tea: saveTea(); default: return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item); } } Next, we\u2019ll add a new method, saveTea(), to handle saving the tea. The saveTea method first reads the name and brew time values chosen by the user, validates them and (if all is well) saves them to the database: // src/com/example/brewclock/AddTeaActivity.java public boolean saveTea() { // Read values from the interface String teaNameText = teaName.getText().toString(); int brewTimeValue = brewTimeSeekBar.getProgress() + 1; // Validate a name has been entered for the tea if(teaNameText.length() < 2) { AlertDialog.Builder dialog = new AlertDialog.Builder(this); dialog.setTitle(R.string.invalid_tea_title); dialog.setMessage(R.string.invalid_tea_no_name); dialog.show(); return false; } // The tea is valid, so connect to the tea database and insert the tea TeaData teaData = new TeaData(this); teaData.insert(teaNameText, brewTimeValue); teaData.close(); return true; } This is quite a hefty chunk of code, so let\u2019s go over the logic.First, we read the values of the EditText teaName and the SeekBar brewTimeSeekBar (remembering to add 1 to the value to ensure a brew time of between 1 and 10 minutes). Next, we validate that a name has been entered that is two or more characters (this is really simple validation; you might want to experiment doing something more elaborate, such as using regular expressions).If the tea name is not valid, we need to let the user know. We make use of one of Android\u2019s helper classes, AlertDialog.Builder, which gives us a handy shortcut for creating and displaying a modal dialog window. After setting the title and error message (using our string resources), the dialogue is displayed by calling its show() method. This dialogue is modal, so the user will have to dismiss it by pressing the \u201cBack\u201d key. At this point, we don\u2019t want to save any data, so just return false out of the method.If the tea is valid, we create a new temporary connection to our tea database using the TeaData class. This demonstrates the advantage of abstracting your database access to a separate class: you can access it from anywhere in the application!After calling teaData.insert() to add our tea to the database, we no longer need this database connection, so we close it before returning true to indicate that the save was successful.Try this out by running the application in the emulator, pressing \u201cMenu\u201d and tapping \u201cAdd Tea.\u201d Once on the \u201cAdd Tea\u201d screen, try saving an empty tea by pressing \u201cMenu\u201d again and tapping \u201cSave Tea.\u201d With your validation in place, you\u2019ll be presented with an error message:Next, try entering a name for your tea, choosing a suitable brew time, and choosing \u201cSave Tea\u201d from the menu again. This time, you won\u2019t see an error message. In fact, you\u2019ll see nothing at all.Improving the User ExperienceWhile functional, this isn\u2019t a great user experience. The user doesn\u2019t know that their tea has been successfully saved. In fact, the only way to check is to go back from the \u201cAdd Tea\u201d Activity and check the list of teas. Not great. Letting the user know that their tea was successfully saved would be much better. Let\u2019s show a message on the screen when a tea has been added successfully.We want the message to be passive, or non-modal, so using an AlertDialog like before won\u2019t help. Instead, we\u2019ll make use of another popular Android feature, the Toast.Toasts display a short message near the bottom of the screen but do not interrupt the user. They\u2019re often used for non-critical notifications and status updates.Start by adding a new string to the strings.xml resource file. Notice the %s in the string? We\u2019ll use this in the next step to interpolate the name of the saved tea into the message! <!-- res/values/strings.xml --> <string name=\"save_tea_success\">%s tea has been saved.</string> Modify the code in onOptionsItemSelected to create and show a Toast pop-up if the result of saveTea() is true. The second parameter uses of getString() interpolate the name of our tea into the Toast message. Finally, we clear the \u201cTea Name\u201d text so that the user can quickly add more teas! // src/com/example/brewclock/AddTeaActivity.java // \u2026 switch(item.getItemId()) { case R.id.save_tea: if(saveTea()) { Toast.makeText(this, getString(R.string.save_tea_success, teaName.getText().toString()), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show(); teaName.setText(\"\"); } // \u2026 Now re-run your application and try adding and saving a new tea. You\u2019ll see a nice Toast pop up to let you know the tea has been saved. The getString() method interpolates the name of the tea that was saved into the XML string, where we placed the %s.Click the \u201cBack\u201d button to return to the application\u2019s main screen, and tap the tea spinner. The new teas you added in the database now show up as options in the spinner!User PreferencesBrewClock is now fully functional. Users can add their favorite teas and the respective brewing times to the database, and they can quickly select them to start a new brew. Any teas added to BrewClock are saved in the database, so even if we quit the application and come back to it later, our list of teas is still available.One thing you might notice when restarting BrewClock, though, is that the brew counter is reset to 0. This makes keeping track of our daily tea intake (a vital statistic!) difficult. As a final exercise, let\u2019s save the total brew count to the device.Rather than adding another table to our teas database, we\u2019ll make use of Android\u2019s \u201cShared Preferences,\u201d a simple database that Android provides to your application for storing simple data (strings, numbers, etc.), such as high scores in games and user preferences.Start by adding a couple of constants to the top of BrewClockActivity.java. These will store the name of your shared preferences file and the name of the key we\u2019ll use to access the brew count. Android takes care of saving and persisting our shared preferences file. // src/com/example/brewclock/BrewClockActivity.java protected static final String SHARED_PREFS_NAME = \"brew_count_preferences\"; protected static final String BREW_COUNT_SHARED_PREF = \"brew_count\"; Next, we\u2019ll need to make some changes to the code so that we can read and write the brew count to the user preferences, rather than relying on an initial value in our code. In BrewClockActivity\u2019s onCreate method, change the lines around setBrewCount(0) to the following: // src/com/example/brewclock/BrewClockActivity.java public void onCreate() { // \u2026 // Set the initial brew values SharedPreferences sharedPreferences = getSharedPreferences(SHARED_PREFS_NAME, MODE_PRIVATE); brewCount = sharedPreferences.getInt(BREW_COUNT_SHARED_PREF, 0); setBrewCount(brewCount); // \u2026 } Here we\u2019re retrieving an instance of the application\u2019s shared preferences using SharedPreferences, and asking for the value of the brew_count key (identified by the BREW_COUNT_SHARED_PREF constant that was declared earlier). If a value is found, it will be returned; if not, we\u2019ll use the default value in the second parameter of getInt (in this case, 0).Now that we can retrieve the stored value of brew count, we need to ensure its value is saved to SharedPreferences whenever the count is updated.Add the following code to setBrewCount in BrewClockActivity: // src/com/example/brewclock/BrewClockActivity.java public void setBrewCount(int count) { brewCount = count; brewCountLabel.setText(String.valueOf(brewCount)); // Update the brewCount and write the value to the shared preferences. SharedPreferences.Editor editor = getSharedPreferences(SHARED_PREFS_NAME, MODE_PRIVATE).edit(); editor.putInt(BREW_COUNT_SHARED_PREF, brewCount); editor.commit(); } Shared preferences are never saved directly. Instead, we make use of Android\u2019s SharedPreferences.Editor class. Calling edit() on SharedPreferences returns an editor instance, which can then be used to set values in our preferences. When the values are ready to be saved to the shared preferences file, we just call commit().With our application\u2019s code all wrapped up, it\u2019s time to test everything!Run the application on the emulator, and time a few brews (this is the perfect excuse to go and make a well-deserved tea or two!), and then quit the application. Try running another application that is installed on the emulator to ensure BrewClock is terminated. Remember that Android doesn\u2019t terminate an Activity until it starts to run out of memory.When you next run the application, you\u2019ll see that your previous brew count is maintained, and all your existing teas are saved!SummaryCongratulations! You\u2019ve built a fully working Android application that makes use of a number of core components of the Android SDK. In this tutorial, you have seen how to:Create a simple SQLite database to store your application\u2019s data;Make use of Android\u2019s database classes and write a custom class to abstract the data access;Add option menus to your application;Create and register new Activities within your application and bind them together into a coherent interface using Intents;Store and retrieve simple user data and settings using the built-in \u201cShared Preferences\u201d database.Data storage and persistence is an important topic, no matter what type of application you\u2019re building. From utilities and business tools to 3-D games, nearly every application will need to make use of the data tools provided by Android.ActivitiesBrewClock is now on its way to being a fully functional application. However, we could still implement a few more features to improve the user experience. For example, you might like to develop your skills by trying any of the following:Checking for duplicate tea name entries before saving a tea,Adding a menu option to reset the brew counter to 0,Storing the last-chosen brew time in a shared preference so that the application defaults to that value when restarted,Adding an option for the user to delete teas from the database.Solutions for the Activities will be included in a future branch on the GitHub repository, where you\u2019ll find the full source-code listings. You can download the working tutorial code by switching your copy of the code to the tutorial_2 branch: # If you\u2019ve not already cloned the repository, # you\u2019ll need to do that first: # $ git clone git://github.com/cblunt/BrewClock.git # $ cd BrewClock $ git checkout tutorial_2 I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed working through this tutorial and that it helps you in designing and building your great Android applications.

Reply 130 Josh March 29th, 2011 6:08 amFreddy, check out Appcelerator Titanium. It is a javascript/css based development tool that still lets you interact with the native phone things (gps, camera, accelerometer, etc).It\u2019s pretty simple to use, I have 4 apps in the app store that are doing quite well. They also received a $15 million investment about 2 months ago, and just acquired Aptana to build a better IDE.They\u2019re supposed to have more of a WYSIWYG editor for release in a month or so.Also, its completely free.

Reply 170 Trademark Litigation March 28th, 2011 11:01 pmHere is a similar storyEclipse and the ADT plugin provide GUIs and wizards to create all three types of projects (Android project, Library project, and Test project): * An Android project contains all of the files and resources that are needed to build a project into an .apk file for installation. You need to create an Android project for any application that you want to eventually install on a device. * You can also designate an Android project as a library project, which allows it to be shared with other projects that depend on it. Once an Android project is designated as a library project, it cannot be installed onto a device. Reply 18+1 rola March 29th, 2011 12:07 amGreat!

Die Facebook-Falle Lage in den Fukushima-Reaktoren ger\u00e4t immer weiter au\u00dfer Kontrolle 30 Jahre Harrisburg Die Energie- und Klimawochenschau: Von Fehlerbalken und von Bedienungsfehlern, die zu Kernschmelzen f\u00fchrten Tepco ist das Ende der Marktwirtschaft Alexander Dill 28.03.2011 In den meisten Wirtschaftsbereichen liegen unkalkulierbare Risiken f\u00fcr die Gemeinschaft, deren Folgen die Unternehmen wirtschaftlich weder tragen k\u00f6nnen noch wollen Bis zum Ende der DDR 1990 schien es, als ob eine sozialistische Planwirtschaft die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Bedrohung f\u00fcr die Marktwirtschaft sei. Die meistem Volkswirte glauben das heute noch. Aber nun gibt es Neuigkeiten: Ein im Gegensatz zu Google bisher weitgehend unbekanntes Unternehmen mit dem Name Tepco bringt es fertig, die gesamte Marktwirtschaft weltweit derart anzugreifen, dass diese fallen k\u00f6nnte wie einst die Sowjetunion 1985. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Die Tokio Electric Power Company ver\u00f6ffentlichte im September 2010 ihren Bericht Vision 2020 (Dokument (PDF)). Ein Manifest von Nachhaltigkeit, CO\u00b2-Einsparung und sozialer Verantwortung. Mit Erfolg: Am 29. September 2010 konnte Tepco neues Kapital in H\u00f6he von 3,2 Milliarden Dollar lukrieren. Verwendungszweck laut B\u00f6rsenprospekt: \"Bau von emissionsfreien Atomkraftwerken.\" Am 13. September 2010 nahm der Dow Jones Sustainabilty Index erstmals eine Reihe von Atomanbietern auf. Tepco hatte zu diesem Zeitpunkt l\u00e4ngst seinen Platz im FTSE4Good Index gefunden \u2013 wegen vorbildlicher sozialer Verantwortung. Die Tepco-Aktie (WKN 854307) ist seit dem bisher als \"Unfall\" verharmlosten, gr\u00f6\u00dften wirtschaftlichen Schaden in der Geschichte der Kernkraft von 18 Euro auf 7 Euro gesunken. W\u00e4hrend offizielle Sch\u00e4tzungen der japanischen Regierung den Gesamtschaden von Erdbeben und Tsunami mit 200-300 Milliarden Dollar beziffern, k\u00f6nnte der durch Tepco verursachte Schaden ein Vielfaches betragen: Wenn der zweitgr\u00f6\u00dfte Industriestaat der Welt keine Automobile mehr exportiert, seine Immobilienpreise einbrechen und ausl\u00e4ndische Firmen und Staaten ihre Vertreter evakuieren sowie Frachter nicht mehr den Hafen von Tokio anlaufen, dann ist eine Billion, dann sind aber auch 2, 3 oder 4 Billionen Dollar schnell erreicht. Die Tepco, die bereits 2007 und 2008 Verluste schrieb, wird nicht einen Bruchteil der Sch\u00e4den begleichen k\u00f6nnen. Damit wird eine f\u00fcr viele unertr\u00e4gliche Wahrheit deutlich: Der Markt, die M\u00e4rkte und ihre \"Marktteilnehmer\" sind nicht im Entferntesten in der Lage, ein so komplexes Thema wie \"Energie\" mit dem Paradigma der Gewinnaussicht zu behandeln. Tepco hat v\u00f6llig veraltete, nie kontrollierte Reaktoren betrieben wie Madoff seinen Fonds: In der Hoffnung, niemand w\u00fcrde es merken. Der neu ernannte Vorsitzende der Ethikkommission der Bundesregierung, Klaus T\u00f6pfer, wagt es, bereits vor Beginn der Arbeit der Kommission folgende Aussage zu machen: Wir sollten aus einer Technik, bei der Ereignisse nicht ausgeschlossen werden k\u00f6nnen, die nicht beherrschbar sind, so schnell wie m\u00f6glich rausgehen. Ein anderes Handeln w\u00e4re nicht verantwortlich. Klaus T\u00f6pfer Das hei\u00dft: Energie kann nicht mehr einem fiktiven \"Energiemarkt\" \u00fcberlassen werden. Wie dann aber Rohstoffe, Lebensmittel, Wasser, W\u00e4hrungen, Kredite, Verkehr, Medikamente, Chemieprodukte und Telekommunikation? In den meisten Wirtschaftsbereichen liegen unkalkulierbare Risiken f\u00fcr die Gemeinschaft, deren Folgen die Unternehmen wirtschaftlich weder tragen k\u00f6nnen noch wollen. Die Opportunit\u00e4tskosten k\u00f6nnen \u2013 etwa im desastr\u00f6sen \u00f6ffentlichen Nahverkehr \u2013 sogar die Ums\u00e4tze der Unternehmen \u00fcbersteigen. Werfen wir einen Blick auf die DAX-30-Unternehmen: Wie viele von ihnen bewegen sich in einem Terrain, das man ohne Risiko f\u00fcr die Allgemeinheit privaten Gewinninteressen anvertrauen kann, darf und soll? Au\u00dfer Turnschuhen und Sportmode (adidas) sowie Unternehmenssoftware (SAP) gibt es bei strengerer Betrachtung kein DAX-Unternehmen, von dem man annehmen kann, dass dessen Wettbewerbsteilnahme ohne ausschlie\u00dfbare, gr\u00f6\u00dfere Sch\u00e4den f\u00fcr das Gemeinwesen verlaufen kann. Das ist eine schlechte Nachricht f\u00fcr die meist ausl\u00e4ndischen Anleger, die bisher in dem religi\u00f6sen Glauben lebten, ihre Gewinne seien durch \"g\u00fcnstige Rahmenbedingungen\" wie niedrige Steuern, keine Konkurrenz, niedrige L\u00f6hne und fehlende \u00dcberwachungen dauerhaft garantiert. Tepco hat den Glauben an die Marktwirtschaft mehr und schneller ruiniert als Tausende von Globalisierungskritikern und Umweltaktivisten. Wenn es k\u00fcnftig noch so etwas wie Marktwirtschaft geben soll, wird sie sich auf die Lebensbereiche beschr\u00e4nken m\u00fcssen, in denen Marktteilnehmer nicht ganze Staaten ruinieren k\u00f6nnen. Damit wird der Markt wieder zum Marktplatz zur\u00fcckkehren. Im f\u00f6deralen Deutschland sollte das kein Problem sein. Dr. Alexander Dill ist nach 20 Jahren in der Wirtschaft wieder in seinen gelernten Beruf als Sozialforscher zur\u00fcckgekehrt. Seit Februar 2010 ist er Vorstand des nach der Finanzkrise gegr\u00fcndeten Basel Institute of Commons and Economics.

Submitted by ckdake on Sun, 2011-02-27 04:39 It's that time for a Gallery Conference again, and this year we're trying something new. You're invited! If you can write code, documentation, design UIs, or provide support, you and your laptop are welcome to join us in Atlanta April 22nd and 23nd to get some work done. April 22nd - Focused \"workshops\" on all things Gallery. We'll get a schedule posted, but expect hour or two long hacking sessions on everything from the remote API to theming to documentation. Bring your questions about projects you're working on, or if you have things you'd like to pitch to the core team. Afterwards will of course be tasty food and drinks. April 23nd - Open Hacking. Network with other Gallery developers in person to pitch in and get work done on your Gallery related projects. Sometime in the afternoon we'll head out to play tourist in Atlanta. Sound like fun? Here's what you need to do: Have played with Gallery 3 in some capacity and be ready to ask specific questions or contribute. This is not an end-user support event or a place to ask other people to do work for you. Get yourself and a laptop with wifi to the event in Atlanta, GA on those dates. (We'll be somewhere reachable by public transit from the Airport.) E-mail gallery@menalto.com your name, what you'd like to get out of the event, and some sort of detail so we know you're serious. Depending on the level of response we get, we may need to limit capacity or alter the schedule. As the event gets closer, we'll post more details. While this event is completely free, you're responsible for getting to and around Atlanta and paying for meals. There's a chance we will be able to provide a lunch, and a good chance Bharat will grab the tab at a bar afterwards, but it all depends on how big the crowd is. Any questions? Ask them here! \u00bb 11 comments Thanks Forum Contributors! Submitted by ckdake on Sun, 2011-01-02 00:33 The Gallery forums have been pretty busy as new and experienced Gallery users tinker with Gallery 3. Over the last 60 days there have been thousands of posts from lots of users, with developers helping users, and users helping other users. It's great to see! Gallery team members bharat, floridave, and nivekiam lead the charts, and the following awesome users all have averaged over 1 post a day for the last 60 days: Serge D, dwdallam, tempg, Armani2, danneh3826, kandsten, undagiga, and sooskriszta. Thanks everyone! Your contributions are noticed and appreciated. \u00bb 5 comments Gallery on Android Submitted by ckdake on Wed, 2010-12-22 14:43 anthony43 just announced the release of ReGalAndroid, and Android client for Gallery 2 and Gallery 3. Search for \"regalandroid\" in the Android market, check it out, and file bugs here if you find any. There is also a discussion thread in our forums. ReGalAndroid currently supports browsing and sharing of items in both Gallery 2 and Gallery 3, and can add new photos only to Gallery 2. Hopefully full Gallery 3 write support is just around the corner! \u00bb 2 comments Gallery 3 Theme Spotlight: GreyDragon Submitted by ckdake on Thu, 2010-12-16 04:17 Serge D has been hard at work for some time on the GreyDragon theme for Gallery3. It's one of the core team's favorites, and if you're looking for something other than the stock Gallery 3 theme, it's definitely worth looking into! Here's what Serge has to say: Started as a way to move my G2 photo gallery into G3 world, the GreyDragon theme is now 1.5 years old. The main goal has been to a build simple yet robust and configurable theme with minimum JavaScript functionality for my web-site, all while having fun testing new things. In part inspired by Mustafa Incel's Carbon theme for G2, GreyDragon now has over 30 configuration options and numerous color packs, making it the most flexible G3 Theme available. Colorpack examples So check it out! \u00bb Login or register to post comments Store your Gallery 3 Images on Amazon S3 Submitted by ckdake on Tue, 2010-11-30 21:17 Does your webhost not have much file space available? Or perhaps are you hosting your Gallery 3 at home behind a slow DSL connection? We recently pulled a module from danneh3826 into the Gallery 3 Contrib repository that may be just what you're looking for. The Amazon S3 module takes over for file storage in Gallery 3 and saves all your images in the cloud on Amazon S3 which tends to be cheap, fast, and reliable.

I like to select a portion of an image that already has a bit of a pattern to it and also has similar colors, say for example a group of flowers. For this tutorial, I\u2019ve chosen an 800\u00d7600 portion from a picture of spring fruit tree blossoms. For now it is much easier to work with a larger image than a tiny one; you can resize the tile when it is finished. The objective of this tutorial is to modify the photo so that the bottom edge matches up with the top edge and the left edge matches with the right creating a seamless, repeating background when it is tiled. Turn the photo inside out so that all of the corners are inverted to the center of the photo. Do this by choosing the Offset filter: Calculate the horizontal and vertical offset values by dividing the dimensions of the photo in half. The photo is 800 pixels wide, so for horizontal, enter 400. The photo is 600 pixels high, so enter 300 for vertical. In the undefined areas box select wrap around. As you can see the photo is now inside out with all four corners in the center. There are now four seams in the middle of the photo. To make the photo into a seamless tile, the seams must disappear. Use the clone, heal, patch, smudge and paint tools to blend the seams until they are no longer visible. First, duplicate the layer so that you will not be working on the original layer (the original will act as a back-up in case you make mistakes). Start with the bottom vertical seam. Match the blue of the sky perfectly by selecting the paint brush tool and then selecting the dropper tool (using the alt key) as you hover over the area you are painting over. Slowly paint out parts of the branches that don\u2019t match up on the opposite side of the seam. Then, clone in some extra edges of the flowers to cover the seam. The smudge tool works well to slowly tug at small parts of the branches to pull them out and cover the seam. Work slowly, using the clone, blend and patch tools to match each side of the seam until the seam completely disappears. Now do the same to the other three seams until they completely disappear. Duplicate the layers so that you will have a separate layer for each quadrant. One way to cover part of the seam in the middle left is to enlarge the group of flowers directly beneath it. This gives you a much clearer and less smudgy result than simply cloning and healing. First, select the bunch of flower using the lasso tool: Then, copy the selection and paste it on top. Using the transform tool (located under Edit) slightly enlarge the bunch of flowers so that they cover the portion of the seam directly on top of them. Next, keeping the enlarged bunch of flowers selected, nudge them into place so that the branches match up as closely as possible. Deselect. Then, using the erase tool (varying the opacity) erase around the edges to blend the selection in. Use the clone and healing tools to blend any remaining edges as necessary. Continue to work on the remaining seam areas until they are all completely undetectable. Using the paint tool and matching the sky color exactly, paint away sections of branches or flowers that do not match with anything on the opposite side of the seam. You can also use the smudge tool to make portions of the branches longer and match them up to other branches, or hide them under bunches of flowers across the seam. Use the clone, healing and patch tools to add on to clumps of flowers to extend them and blend them into the branches to cover the seam. Finally, we\u2019ve gotten rid of all four center seams. We\u2019re almost finished creating the seamless tile, but now we need to turn the photo right side out again. Do this by repeating the offset command from the 3rd step. Enter the values exactly as you did earlier. Sometimes when the photo is turned right side out again, a tiny seam can appear in the center if the image was worked too close to the edges. Fix this seam the same way as the others. The final step is to flatten and resize the image to the background tile size that you need. I decided to make this one 400\u00d7300 just because I think it looks the best in that size. The image tiles seamlessly! This tutorial was created by Pixblix.com.

Too many times I see the sad example of someone walking in to a situation with noble intentions and then getting royally screwed, because what they see as an opportunity and a labor of love, the other party sees as something else entirely, not at all romantic or idealized, but raw and simple. You are going to be dealing with people who are unlike yourself. Their motivations are their own and their attitudes are probably different than yours. When you're in education, you may have tough teachers and think that it can't be worse, but wait until a business person has a hundred grand riding on your work! Then you will know what demanding means. This list wasn't meant to make anyone crazy or paranoid, but is designed to inject some reality into the fantasy. 1. Do this one cheap (or free) and we'll make it up on the next one. No reputable business person would first give away their work and time or merchandise on the hope of making it up later. Can you imagine what a plumber would say if you said come in, provide and install the sink for free and next time we'll make it up when we need a sink. You would be laughed at! Also the likelyhood is that if something important came along, they wouldn't use you. 2. We never pay a cent until we see the final product. This is a croc, unless the person is leaving the door open to cheat you out of your pay. Virtually every profession requres a deposit or incremental payment during anything but the smallest project. Once you have a working relationship, you may work out another arrangement with a client. But a new client should not ask you to go beyond an initial meeting and, perhaps some preliminary sketches without pay on the job. 3. Do this for us and you'll get great exposure! The jobs will just pour in! Baloney. Tell a plumber Install this sink and my friend will see and you'll get lots of business! Our plumber friend would say You mean even if I do a good job I have to give my work away to get noticed? Then it isn't worth the notice. Also the guy would likely brag to everyone he knows about how this would normally cost (X) dollars, but brilliant businessman that he is he got if for free! If anyone calls, they'll expect the same or better deal. 4. On looking at sketches or concepts: Well, we aren't sure if we want to use you yet, but leave your material here so I can talk to my partner/investor/wife/clergy. You can be sure that 15 minutes after you leave he will be on the phone to other designers, now with concepts in hand, asking for price quotes. When you call back you will be informed that your prices were too high and Joe Blow Design/Illustration will be doing the job. Why shouldn't they be cheaper? You just gave them hours of free consulting work! Until you have a deal, leave nothing creative at the clients office. 5. Well, the job isn't CANCELLED, just delayed. Keep the account open and we'll continue in a month or two. Ummm, probably not. If something is hot, then not, it could be dead. It would be a mistake to not bill for work performed at this point and then let the chips fall where they may! Call in two months and someone else may be in that job. And guess what? They don't know you at all... 6. Contract? We don't need no stinking contact! Aren't we friends? Yes, we are, until something goes wrong or is misunderstood, then you are the jerk in the suit and I am that idiot designer, then the contract is essential. That is, unless one doesn't care about being paid. Any reputable business uses paperwork to define relationships and you should too. 7. Send me a bill after the work goes to press. Why wait for an irrelevant deadline to send an invoice? You stand behind your work, right? You are honest, right? Why would you feel bound to this deadline? Once you deliver the work and it is accepted, BILL IT. This point may just be a delaying tactic so the job goes through the printer prior to any question of your being paid. If the guy waits for the job to be printed, and you do changes as necessary, then he can stiff you and not take a chance that he'll have to pay someone else for changes. 8. The last guy did it for XXX dollars. That is irrelevant. If the last guy was so good they wouldn't be talking to you, now would they? And what that guy charged means nothing to you, really. People who charge too little for their time go out of business (or self-destruct financially, or change occupations) and then someone else has to step in. Set a fair price and stick to it. 9. Our budget is XXX dollars, firm. Amazing, isn't it? This guy goes out to buy a car, and what, knows exactly what he is going to spend before even looking or researching? Not likely. A certain amount of work costs a certain amount of money. If they have less money (and you can), do less work and still take the job. But make sure they understand that you are doing less work if you take less money that you originally estimated. Give fewer comps, simplify, let them go elsewhere for services (like films) etc. 10. We are having financial problems. Give us the work, we'll make some money and we'll pay you. Simple. Yeah, except when the money comes, you can expect that you will be pretty low on the list to be paid. If someone reaches the point where they admit that the company is in trouble, then they are probably much worse off than they are admitting to. Even then, are you a bank? Are you qualified to check out their financials? If the company is strapped to the point where credit is a problem through credit agencies, banks etc. what business would you have extending credit to them. You have exactly ZERO pull once they have the work. Noble intentions or not, this is probably a losing bet. But if you are going to roll the dice, AT LEAST you should be getting additional money for waiting. The bank gets interest and so should you. That is probably why the person is approaching you; to get six months worth of free interest instead of paying bank rates for credit and then paying you with that money. Don't give away money. In the end, working commercially, being great at what you do is about 25% of the task. If that is the only part of the task that you are interested in, do yourself a favor.

Many years ago, as I was burning out on a disastrous account, the morning I planned to terminate the relationship my horoscope quoted a 19th Century aphorism: \"Verbal contracts are worth the paper they're written on.\" THAT was all the further encouragement I needed. As for budget, I don't believe it's so far-fetched that a client will insist on a frozen budget; if they're doing like all of the consultants advise, they're dividing their period expenditures into proportions per business task, based on some coefficient of the numbers from this-time-last-year. When met with that challenge, it's the designer's job to maintain backbone and prioritize (on the basis of the findings from the assessment) what can be done with that money. ...And unless I'm intending some sort of informal/ad-hoc arrangement, my stock answer to small business clients is \"$x per hour, and if you need to ask, you probably can't afford it.\" I hate that, but it's the most effective way to ensure - especially if you do assessments for free - that a small biz client's got their pennies saved before they start talking with you in earnest. login or register to post comments so true ... Submitted by thecatat on February 6, 2007 - 01:23. We started Creative Latitude and NO!SPEC for those reasons and more. On NO!SPEC we compiled everything we could on the subject of working on the speculation of getting a fair return. Sure, there are grey areas. But it's up to the individual designer to decide for themselves on what they'll do. Or not. For whatever. Our aim was to make sure the information was available so the decision could be an informed one. cat login or register to post comments Scope Creep Submitted by Brad Henry on February 8, 2007 - 16:12. One of the biggest issues I have seen and should probably be on the list above is Scope Creep. Many times when you begin a project you will create the scope and pricing based on that. Then as you get into the project you find out that the client wants this or that which he thinks should be included in the project when in reality it is not defined in the scope. This will cost you time and money. When creating a scope, be careful to explain that the project only includes what is defined in the scope to a narrow degree and that any additions or adjustments will have to be calculated and the scope along with pricing will have to be adjusted. By establishing this upfront, you should not have any issues raising cost if the client changes his demands or tries to tack on last minute things.

We all made that mistake when we started out but it still sometimes happens to us (Although only mimimally). In a service oriented industry, especially ours, it's still sometimes tough to educate clients on how seriously we take ourselves. Also, regarding the 3. Do this for us and you'll get great exposure! The jobs will just pour in!, the most exposure comes from clients who care about the job being done right. If they have the nerve to think they can fob you off like this, in our experience, they are not worth it. Dave Davis login or register to post comments excelent picks... Submitted by amirbilal on February 12, 2007 - 12:51. these are all really good findings. \"Do this one cheap (or free) and we'll make it up on the next one.\" This really happens a lot of times when you find a company which is new in the business. Sometimes people go beyond the limits and do things to the extent that they sound like totally non-professionals. They just try to work as they are paying the developer/designer for doing nothing. One more interesting thing is that, I have encountered some people who would say: \"you would already have News, Advertisements and other similar modules ready with you so its going to take just a little amount of time\" and then trying to convince me that I shouldn't count these modules in the cost estimation :D login or register to post comments Agree with this post. Submitted by Harvey Kane on February 12, 2007 - 21:57. Agree with this post. I think a lot of us started out with these sorts of clients, and still do deal with them. You need to be confident in what you do so you can turn down these kinds of jobs. login or register to post comments The rules Submitted by davidfsmith on February 22, 2007 - 22:04. A friend of mine uses a great pitch as an argument for some of these.... You can have 2 out of 3 - You can have it fast - You can have it cheap - You can have it right So the client can have it fast and cheap (but not right) or cheap and right (but not fast) it gets the point across well, failing that in business if it doesn't feel right then it probably isn't Oh and certainly agree with #4 seen it happen loads of times (not in the same company!) Regards Dave login or register to post comments RE: The Rules Submitted by misterjangles on February 25, 2007 - 20:19. I think the saying goes: Cost, Speed or Quality - you can only have two of three three. (ie, you can only compromise on one). Cost as in low cost to get the work done, speed as in the speed the work gets done and quality, as in \"done right\" which you said. Clients will typically start off wanting both speed and cost. so the challenge is to educate them that they can't have both. If they won't budge, then it's often a red flag that this will be a difficult client. However, that's not to say that you shouldn't take a project if they are willing to compromise on one of the points. I have some great clients with low budgets, but they are OK if I don't deliver the work until three months later. These are excellent clients for filling your schedule and keeping your billed hours up at the max. Also a client that wants something really fast, but is willing to pay your \"rush\" rate - those can be very disruptive to your schedule, but sometimes it's worth it for an injection of cash. We all have our price! If a client wants to compromise on quality, they'll never understand what this truly means and you probably will wind up paying the cost to fix the problems that arise. I will only take a project like this if it's billed as hourly labor with no agreement about deliverables. login or register to post comments Good list, nice work ;) Submitted by MichaelS on April 1, 2007 - 14:46.

Nothing you can charge them for, really --after all, it only takes you about three minutes to send them an answer; and isn't Great Customer Service one of the things that sets you apart from your competitors? The client's happy (or so you assume), you're happy (for having done Good Deeds) --and then, at the end of the year, the client tells you that he's not going to renew the contract because he has found someone \"who can do the job at a lower price.\" Grrrr... login or register to post comments And we are not as guilty? Submitted by espmartin on May 3, 2007 - 02:30. I've noticed a tendency to point our fingers at the client, but if we're to be honest, sometimes we as the \"web guys\" are just as guilty as that client! I mean, I've heard colleagues state to their clients, \"Oh yeah, I can do that within your timeframe!\". I could go on and on, but my main point is that we should \"look to the beam in our own eyes before we point and pick at the thorn in our clients eyes\"...

That never works out as well as you hope. General rule-of-thumb: the sales guys always over-estimate by a factor of 10. If you base your royalty compensation on their estimates, even for a slam-dunk product, you'll get a dime on the dollar. Here's a trick: front-load the royalties. Tell them that they need to pay you 100% of the difference on the first 10% of the sales, and then ask for only 10% of what they were offering on all the rest of the sales. Because they are asking you to take on risk, they will probably have offered you significantly more than your asking price \"in the long run.\" (If they didn't, just walk away). So it will work out much better for them if they actually make their promised sales volumes, and if they make more than 10% of their estimated sales, it works out better for you. But never lower your base rate by more than 30% under any conditions, on the promise of vast wealth when their product \"takes off.\" login or register to post comments You live and learn Submitted by t4tw on June 22, 2007 - 21:47.

I like this one the best 6. Contract? We don't need no stinking contact! Aren't we friends? Yes, we are, until something goes wrong or is misunderstood, then you are the jerk in the suit and I am that idiot designer, then the contract is essential. That is, unless one doesn't care about being paid. Any reputable business uses paperwork to define relationships and you should too. Many times I have been caught out with this one myself - nice to see someone else actually saying this too !

The one I seem to be plagued with is the scenario where a start up approaches you wanting SEO or web design, but wants to enlist your help for delayed future benefits such as profit share, a place on his phantom board of directors or some such. At first I took a lot of these quite seriously but eventually I got sick of seeing a fatal flaw in their product, expected return on investment or seeing a dire lack of research. I'm not a business analyst and I don't want to be a business analyst so these days all these offers get a resounding 'no', before I even bother looking at them. Some of these guys can be quite pushy as well, but I think the best advice to give them is to backup their business venture with cold hard cash if they are so assured of success. I'm not a great fan of VC capital but if I had a surefire business plan and no money that's where I'd go. Anyway, if a project is big enough to split into stages, then these are the payment stages and that should be made clear in project documentation - as Franko mentions, paperwork is crucial. There are also a number of things you can do to help make payment more likely and more timely - I use pdf invoices with a paypal payment button programmed in, so that payment is often pretty instantaneous, and then there's the commonsense strategy of stipulating payment on completion rather than upon going live or implementing. This way no pay, no product. Like everyone else, I have my late payers, but some of the strategies I use really do help to limit them. login or register to post comments I am a freelancer and know Submitted by Mike1 on October 1, 2007 - 15:44.

Nice all your comments about the 10 rules of why clinets would not being paying. BUT NOW I WILL TELL YOU WHY CUSTOMERS LIKE ME WILL NEVER EVER PAY ANYMORE SOME MONEY IN ADVACE TO A DEVELOPER. Had such a nice experience with a developer that if they ever want me as a client It will be being paid after everything is live. paid 12.500 GBP in advance for a project and halfway again 12.500GBP and 3 weeks before the project would be supossed going live the Developer is gone and can't not being found anymore. 1. My start up company straight bankrupt 2. Lost all my credibilty in the Industry I was working because left my old job to start my own it related business and approached when the cunt of a developer told me that we would go live in a few weeks after a delay on his project of 7 months 3. Developers are for me a bunch of greedy people who are first off all don't listen to what the customer wants and second of all only care for the money and not the concept they are working on. AND TO MAKE FEEL YOU GUYS DEVELOPERS BETTER, THAT PERSON HAD A Phd In SOFTWARE ENGINEERING SO AS YOU CAN SEE MY DEAR DEVELOPERS STAY NICELY IN YOUR OFFICE AND THINK THAT YOU PEOPLE FOUND THE HOLLY CRAL, BECAUSE AFTER DOING RESEARCH I'M FAR FROM A ONE OFF CASE. I FOUND IN A TIME OF 4 MONTHS MORE THEN 95 PEOPLE IN THE LONDON AREA WHO AT LEAST HAS LOST MORE THEN 5000GBP IN A RIP OFF FROM NICE DEVELOPERS WHO ARE HERE YELLING THE HARDST ABOUT BEING PAID INFRONT OF A START OF A PROJECT. so the whole thing I try to say overhere is that you people would be better off judging customer by customer. login or register to post comments Ga maar leuk in de rij staan Submitted by netclickx on December 18, 2009 - 15:38.

Mobile development is about so much more than APIs and the latest models of phones\u2014it is about making a difference in the way we live, work and play. Reading this book should be the first task in any new mobile development project. Period.\u201d \u2014Frank Ableson President MSI Services Inc. Author of Unlocking Android Mobile Editor for Linux Magazine March 2011 Thank you for your interest and support for Mobile Design and Development: Practical Concepts and Techniques for Creating Mobile Sites and Web Apps the book I wrote in 2008-2009 and published by O'Reilly in September 2009! In the book I share my advice and experience working with publishing content to mobile devices from the past decade and discuss what I think will be important in the next decade of mobile and the web. Even though mobile is one of the fastest growing industries on the planet with things changing every day, I spent a considerable amount of thought and time to try to fill the book with timeless advice that isn't specific to a particular platform or en vogue device. Who is this book for? Read the original book Preface I wrote this book to have something for everyone interested in designing in developing for mobile devices, regardless of experience and regardless of the application. The first half is a crash course in the mobile ecosystem: how to develop a strategy, address the mobile context\u2014even how to decide which of the multiple mobile application types is best for you, and finally, how to create a user experience for it. The second half is focused on using these principles to make a mobile website or web app. This means this book isn't for anyone looking for a quick fix to the \u201cmobile problem.\u201d As I told my excellent editorial team throughout the writing process, \u201cthis is a book that teaches people how to cook, not a collection of recipes.\u201d However being O'Reilly's first book on mobile, we decided to cover a lot of ground, basically detailing mobile from it's origins to the devices of tomorrow. Is it up to date? The Table of Contents for this site, which remains 75-80% up to date from when it was published I would say about 75-80% of the content of the book (which is some 68,000 words) is up to date and extremely relevant as of March 2011. Not too bad when you consider I began writing some of the chapters within this book over five years ago. In fact there are a number of topics that I discuss in this book that are becoming highly relevant as time goes on. The purpose of this site is to begin the process of updating content and adding more content and focus around the topic of mobile design, an area that has significantly increased in its importances and relevance, but still understood by very few. Honestly I have enough information to write an entirely new book just on mobile design, but without some of the other chapters already present in this book, it would feel incomplete. So O'Reilly has been kind enough to allow me to provide the entire text of the original book on this site so I can begin the update process in an iterative fashion. Mobile Design & Development: Revisited Updates will be made separately from the original text, keeping the words, flow and spirit of the first edition intact. Being an early adopter myself that last thing I want to do is make the original book obsolete, not to mention undo the amazing work from the first editorial team. The only exception is the breaking up of chapters, and blocks of text to make the book more readable in the CONTEXT! (a key theme of the book) New content will mostly consist of noting the content that has become obsolete and providing separate sections labeled with a \u201cRevisited\u201d heading that will share some of the changes that had occurred around the particular topic. The majority of updates will be new chapters that explore the complexity and craft of mobile design in new detail, expanding upon the original text. Should I still buy the book? In a word: Yes! Without people like you buying books like this, people like me can't take time away from our day jobs to write. If authors lose the support of publishers like O'Reilly, knowledge and information will just be randomly thrown about the web without any context at all. O'Reilly is taking a gamble with me publishing the book here, free for anyone to read. So if you like what you see, please consider supporting other technical authors and publishers by purchasing a digital or physical copy of this book to share with a friend.

It allowed you to easily create a scribble a short note on the screen,and then quickly enter an alarm time. With it, I was able to easily remember silly little things like \u2018call joe back\u2019 or \u2018pick up milk\u2019Accordingly, as soon as I got a few spare days, I wrote a similar app called Remindly and have now open-sourced it under the GPL3.

Really... Here Come Targeted Mobile Coupons. Really Mobile coupons are a favorite of both advertiser and consumer for clear reasons: consumers don\u2019t mind having their devices touched by commercial interests if they get a deal out of it' advertisers know they have the user\u2019s attention. Ever since coupons\u2019 love affair with mobile technology began a few years ago, the ideal was the targeted consumer: someone on hoof, near a, say, Starbucks or local pub, who might be interested in 10% off a morning coffee or happy hour special. While such offers are seen here and there in the market, usually courtesy Foursquare or Gowalla, they are by no means the majority of offerings. Only slightly more than four in 10 (43%) mobile advertising campaigns last year were aimed at a targeted audience, with 57% launched as broad reach campaigns, according to a Millennial Media SMART Report (via MarketingCharts). When people were targeted, they were largely done by geography (40%). According to prior Millennial Media analysis, this targeted reach method resonates strongly with advertisers in the travel vertical, particularly hotels and resorts, who are able to reach visitors new to the area with relevant messages. Google's Ploy That all may change when Google and Apple embrace near-field communications. While neither company has commented formally on their plans there have been numerous leaks that both are working on technology that will allow consumers to pay for items at a retail point of sale by waiving their devices at a special reader. The latest anonymous-sourced report comes from the Wall Street Journal. With Google on track to building and delivering this functionality for Android - according to the Journal that is - advertisers can expect more ad options for mobile users. The Journal article posits that Google will not be taking a cut of the transaction. Rather it will share data with retailers about these mobile users, allowing them to deliver targeted mobile ads to their devices, with coupons being a top format.

If your company deals with people, you can bet that some of them will be unhappy, no matter how hard you try to please them. If your brand has a sizeable online presence, you can bet that a lot of this criticism will be on the internet, where just about anyone can see it. Even worse, competitors often leave negative comments about competing businesses to give themselves an advantage. You need to know what is being written about your small business on the internet so you can control it\u2014but how? Luckily, there are a variety of ways to keep tabs on your small business brand. Some of the options on this list are free, while others cost money, but what they all have in common is security for the small business brand you have worked so hard to create. Work the blog circuit. People routinely mention companies that they deal with on their blogs, and this can be positive or negative. You can monitor buzz on the blogosphere in a variety of ways. First, you can get a Delicious account, which is completely free. This will allow you to easily see what others are blogging about you. Second, you should register both your personal and corporate blogs on Technorati, which is basically a blog search engine. This website, which is also completely free, tracks \u201cblog reactions\u201d and other vital information being shared about your company. Get search engine alerts. Search engine alerts tell you when new information has been posted anywhere on the internet for a given search term. We recommend that you use these to see what is being said out there about your small business. Google Alerts and Yahoo! Pipes are both free tools that notify you when you are mentioned on the internet. Monitor social networking. More and more, social networks are where people speak their minds to friends and family. Unfortunately, many of these comments are viewable and searchable by just about anyone. Twitter is easy to monitor thanks to Twitter search, but you can also get updates from TweetBeep and similar Twitter monitoring services. Social Mention will give you similar information from almost all social networking sites including YouTube and Flickr. Get updates on discussion boards. Discussion boards, just like blogs and social networking accounts, are a place where people openly discuss their opinions. This means that you have an opportunity to see what your customers really think. Boardtracker.com is a free tool that instantly alerts you when you are mentioned on a discussion board. Comprehensive programs. There are many programs on the internet that will monitor your brand image through a variety of channels and sift through the results to find ones that are significant. The best known of these are Buzzlogic, Radian6, Trackur, and Reputation Defender. These are all good, legit companies, each with benefits and drawbacks. However, they all cost money, from nominal amounts to pretty substantial sums. As your business grows, you will have to decide how much time and money monitoring your reputation is worth and implement plans that fit your needs.

And it goes with dance moves that involve\u2014you guessed it\u2014moving to the left. But what Beyonce, and many of us for that matter, might not realize is that some people may not have any idea what \u201cto the left\u201d means with respect to the location of their own bodies in space. Now one would think knowing the position of where we move our feet and hands is pretty much the same across cultures. Meaning it\u2019s \u201cegocentric,\u201d and we\u2019d describe moving our feet to the left relative to us, and not to the east relative to a compass. But a new study finds that the way children understand their own body movement actually depends on their culture. \u00a0The research will appear in the journal Current Biology. When German children were taught to move their hands in a right-left-right-right motion, as part of a dance choreography, they maintained this movement even after changing their body orientation by 180 degrees. But children from the Akhoe Hai || om, a hunter-gatherer tribe from Namibia, changed the right-left-right-right sequence to the exact opposite (left-right-left-left) when they turned their bodies 180 degrees.\u00a0 This means that they were referencing the movement of their own limbs based on some external reference in their environment\u2026meaning east, west, north, south. The study author notes that this finding is a reminder of just how plastic the human mind is, and of the wide diversity in human cognition across cultures. And a reminder to Beyonce that \"to the left, to the left\" is absolutely replaceable, depending on who you are talking to. \u2014Christie Nicholson [The above text is an exact transcript of the audio in the podcast.] Post a Comment | Read Comments (2) Reprints and Permissions\u00a0\u00bb Share 2 Comments Add Comment View Oldest to Newest Newest to Oldest 1.

Update #1 DOH! We had a few contestants who got hosed due to over aggressive spam filters. We\u2019re figuring out a way to get them into the game that\u2019s fair. As a result we may delay the start of the contest a few days. SORRY! More to come. Hello, people of the internet! On March 29th, a contest will begin to see who you think should be crowned the next Happy Webbie. We asked you to tell us who inspires you, and you did. In fact, you told us about more than 200 people. After a few weeks of sorting through the entries and explaining the concept, we now have our 64 contestants. Before we go any further, let me say we\u2019ve already achieved our goal. This list acknowledges people in our industry who have helped others become better at their craft either directly or indirectly. Many of these names were unknown to us, and that freakin\u2019 rocks. Let\u2019s share the love! The best part was we didn\u2019t have to make any tough decisions or exclude anyone. These 64 are the people who wanted to participate. It\u2019s a little freaky that we got exactly 64, but we\u2019ll take it. This is the last time you\u2019ll see the contestants\u2019 names until we start posting people who have been eliminated. At that time, we\u2019ll also list their accomplishments as well as links to follow them online. During the contest they will be competing under fictitious names to keep the playing field a little more level. As we\u2019ve said before, we\u2019re doing our best to avoid a popularity contest. Without further adieu, ladies and gentlemen, I present your Webbie Madness contestants!

Over the years, I\u2019ve gotten a lot of credit for knowing how to run a successful business. This is funny to me because I think the key is to be nice and keep your commitments. Oh, and surround yourself with awesomely talented people. Over time, you\u2019ll have enough of a following that the business supports itself through word of mouth. That\u2019s why some companies that make it don\u2019t appear to have a great product. And why some of the most talented people seem to struggle getting work. Today as I was reviewing my to-do list, I realized I didn\u2019t want \u201cto do\u201d most of it. I figured I was just a little burned out from having so many things to manage in my day-to-day life. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m grateful for everything I have. nGen Works has given me the ability to live life on my terms. I\u2019m not wealthy by any means, but I can come and go as I please. Or can I? This was the question I asked myself. What if I just quit doing the things I don\u2019t want to do. What would happen? As a tribute to Charlie Sheen\u2019s insanity I created two categories, \u201cwinning\u201d and \u201closing.\u201d Once I started assigning my tasks I quickly created a third category called \u201c?.\u201d I realized that I didn\u2019t know whether many of the things I do are winners or losers. To try to have some semblance of knowledge for what drives nGen, I looked over the current project list. Here is where our current projects came from: 80% \u2013 Referrals/Relationships 20% \u2013 Promotion It wasn\u2019t lost on me that our business fit nicely into the 80/20 rule. The question becomes how much does that 20 percent of promotion feed the other 80 percent? Or is it all set in motion and my efforts only steer it a little in a positive direction, if at all? Or am I just trying to rationalize my way out of doing work I\u2019m not excited about? Regardless, I\u2019m starting a two-week experiment today. If I\u2019m not excited about it, I\u2019m not going to do it. And if nobody else on the nGen team wants to do it then it\u2019s gone. Buh-bye. Obviously, some of the things I don\u2019t want to do involve taxes and paperwork. And not getting fined and going to jail are great incentives, so I\u2019ll find a way to have those done. Here\u2019s how my list broke down: Winning Creating fun Contests Events Learning Reading Conferences Conversations Sharing what we\u2019ve learned Writing Speaking & workshops Making videos Solving problems Business experiments Launching products Losing Managing Company growth Difficult clients Projects Wasting time Meaningless conversations Trying to please haters Focusing on problems ? New biz process Analyzing nGen\u2019s past Predicting nGen\u2019s future What becomes obvious for me as I review this list is everything under Winning creates positive energy. Everything under Losing sucks the energy out of me. And with the ? category I just don\u2019t know that it matters. It really does feel like busywork that\u2019s neither positive or negative. While I can\u2019t just walk away from things like difficult clients, I can act more swiftly to correct the issues. And if you\u2019ve ever fired a difficult client you know it creates an amazing positive energy. So maybe that\u2019s part of the experiment. Only focus on the positive energy, not the neutral or negative. What scares me is I\u2019ll find that all the hard work for eight years wasn\u2019t really necessary. What scares me more is I\u2019ll find out it was! 6 Comments Carl Smith // March 2, 2011 nGen Express Update - Time For A Tune-Up A few months back we launched nGen Express. We\u2019ve been asked how it\u2019s going, so welcome to update time! First, we\u2019ve learned a ton. People were really excited out of the gate and we had quite a few people sign up. Not many actually started their projects, though. So that sucked. 8^) To find out what the problem was we did what communication professionals should do. We spent time listening to prospects. Especially those who bailed at purchase. The common thread is confusion over what the heck we\u2019re selling. Seems we fell into the oldest client trap of them all. We thought nGen Express was simple to understand, but it wasn\u2019t. In fact it was downright confusing. The clients we did get each had a conversation with me where I explained the process. Obviously that level of interaction for each customer isn\u2019t sustainable or profitable. With that in mind, we sat down to figure out how to simplify nGen Express. The big shift in thinking is we\u2019re selling a professional comp, not a redesigned web page. The word \u201ccomp\u201d seemed to solidify for prospects what they were getting. We\u2019re also simplifying the pricing and some other areas based on the input we received. We\u2019ll let you know once we\u2019ve got some revisions live. Until then, get back to work. Nothing to see here! 0 Comments Our blog Find out what\u2019s on our minds and tell us what\u2019s on yours.

The program has translations into English, Spanish, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Serbian and Swedish. The documentation is excellent, although currently most is only in English, but this situation is changing rapidly. If have any questions after reading this web page, please subscribe to the Chessdb-users@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list (you will need to subscribe before you can post to the list). In the same way that to play online bingo succesfully one needs to keep track of all the information involved in the game, so too chessDB will allow you to keep track of all your chess information, helping you to master the game. Additionally if you ever choose to play at an online casino you'll find that they all generally offer tracking info that let's you view the logs of each gaming transaction that you commit to. This helps to instill confidence in players but more so allows players to go back and look at each single game they've ever played. What a chess database can do In addition to this fully-featured chess database, there are a number of others available both free and commercial. This section describes in very broad terms basically why they are useful. Chess databases in general provide: A convenient way to store your own games in a way where the right game can be quickly found. They can be sorted by a number of different criteria, and searched for quickly. A very time-efficient method to study, which will give the maximum improvement in the minimum time. The features which help you study vary from database to database. The specific features of ChessDB are given further down this web page. Access to statistics about both your own games and of GMs, which would be impractical to collect without a computer based chess database. Main features of ChessDB ChessDB is based very heavily on the highly successful Scid which was the premier free chess database. There are a large number of features. in ChessDB. It is not a cut-down/light/crippled (call it what you want) version of an expensive commercial product, but you get a complete fully functional program. With ChessDB can: Enter games by either Moving the pieces with a mouse. Typing in the moves from a keyboard 1.e4 etc. Read games from a PGN file - the standard used for chess games. (In ChessDB 3.6.13 and later, it is possible to read all the PGN files in one directory, making it quick to import a lot of games.) Download them directly into ChessDB from The Week in Chess (TWIC). Import games from the history of anyone on ICC - you can rapidly download the recent games played by people whose games you wish to study. (FICS support will be be introduced by the end of March 2007). A combination of the above 6. Annotate the games by adding Text comments Add standard symbols such as !! (excellent move), ?? (blunder), =+ (black as a slight advantage) etc. Add coloured symbols to games, to indicate whatever you want. Lots of different symbols may be used, and lots of different colours Variations showing different lines which may have been interesting. Analyse a position with GM strength chess engines such as Crafty and Toga. Create Tournament Crosstables. Play against many different chess engines from very weak ones to strong chess engines such as Crafty and Toga II. However, ChessDB's roots in Scid are very much as a database more than a tool to play chess in. So ChessDB lacks some features you would want to play a decent game of chess, such as sensible time controls. Play two chess engines each other to find the strongest. Again, to be fair, this is not one of the tasks ChessDB was designed for, so if you are organising the next chess computer world championship, we suggest you look for more appropriate software. But for the occasional game, it works okay. Save games in either Standard PGN format HTML (for web pages) LaTeX (a high quality DTP/typesetting format) Set the pieces on the chessboard then use the Board Search tool to find games in a database which have either the Exact position - (all pieces on the same squares) Pawns - same material, all pawns in the same position. Same material, all pawns on the same files Same material and pawns, but they can be anywhere on the board Generate a rating graph showing the rating vs time of a player. (There can be two players on the same graph) Generate a player report, showing statistics of a single player with either the Black or White pieces. Classify games according to self defined criteria. (For example, rook endings, games with blunder, games with isolated queens pawn etc etc) Email games for correspondance chess, using the built in email client. Use the Header Search tool to find games with specific data in the header, such as: Player names Player titles - GM, IM, FW, WGM, WFM, W Event Site Round Result Date or range of dates. ECO code and many other search criteria Answer questions like: Is it worth spending much time to study the move 4.Bd2 in the Nimzo Indian defence? The answer is it depends since GMs play 4.Bd2 in less than 0.5% of games with the Nimzo Indian, but players on ICC of about 1400 play it 40% of the time. Such data is useful. Verify the version in use is the current one or if it old What ChessDB can not do (as of 2009-12-18) There are things that ChessDB can not do, which other software can do. You can not easily use ChessDB to connect to chess servers such as the Chessboss, Internet Chess Club (ICC) or the Free Internet Chess Server (FICS) to play games. ChessDB can connect to both ICC and FICS - once connected you can download games played in the past, but unless you are willing to type in the commands to move, you can't use ChessDB to play games. Support for this might be added, as it will not be that hard to do, but does rather get away from the original concept of Scid, which was a chess database. ChessDB does not allow you to embed photographs or video clips into games, although ChessDB does allow you to add player photographs, which will be displayed when one of that players game is being viewed. ChessDB does not store information for other types of games such as online roulette. For other strategy games you will need a different database. ChessDB can not read proprietary file formats such as those used by ChessBase, ChessAssistant and Bookup. However, all these chess databases can save games to PGN format, which ChessDB can read. Other chess databases We feel ChessDB will be the best choice for many people, but there are other chess databases around. Some of them include: The commercial company ChessBase sell a wide range of chess software. One of their best-known products is a chess database which is also called ChessBase (just to confuse you!) It is well known, but not cheap. It only runs on Windows. The current version (December 2006) is ChessBase 9. ChessBase also give away free a chess database called ChessBase Light It is severely crippled (only 8000 games per database), making it useless for serious work, but OK for the most basic of tasks. Again, this only runs on Windows. Convekta sell a chess database called Chess Assistant. The current (December 2006) is Chess Assistant 9 Like ChessBase, Convekta give away a light (or crippled) version, called Chess Assistant Light Bookup is another commercial database.. Scid is a free chess database written by Shane Hudson, on which ChessDB is based. Another free chess database is jose. Like Scid and ChessDB, jose really is free and not simply a crippled version of a commercial product. Like ChessDB, jose is multi-platform, running under Windows, Linux, OS X and UNIX. ChessX is another chess database which is being actively developed The plagiarist Pascal Geroges has released a version of Scid, in which he took lots of code from ChessDB, but claimed he wrote it. See here for more information. As you can see, there are a number of chess databases around. There can be little doubt that at the time of writing (December 2006), there is no better free database. Whether things like Chessbase are better depends on who you talk to. Binaries Binaries (i.e. what most people call programs) which can be easily installed will be made available where possible. Currently we have Setup.exe for Microsoft Windows Mac OS X binaries for PPC (not universal) which were built on 10.4.8. I've not tested this myself Screenshots The look of ChessDB varies a little depending on the platform. Here are some screenshots under Windows, Mac OS X and Solaris (UNIX). Screen shots taken with Microsoft Windows XP Professional Main Window Player Information Setting up the start board The built in help pages XP Pro with SP2 startup window (this is a bit large, so downloads slowly) Screen shots taken with a Mac running OS X ChessDB starting up Main Window #1 Main Window #2 Main Window #3 Screen shots on a UNIX system (Solaris 10 in this case) Main Window Player rating graph Player Report Website administered by Dr. David Kirkby This page was last modified: March 15, 2010. 22:53:16 pm GMT "}

If instead of IE you have Firefox, then with the right click you will not have the \u201cDownload selected by Orbit\u201d, but instead a \u201cDownload All by Orbit\u201d and so, you will get in the next window more links to download because it refers to the entire page. So you will have a little more work to disable the files you don\u2019t want to download. I hope this helps you - the list ordered - In \u201cLocation\u201d, inside the \u201cPreferences Settings\u201d, choose the destination folder http://bkmacdaddy.com/blog/the-macdaddy-links-of-the-week-070509 MacDaddy Links of the Week \u2013 7/5/09 | bkmacdaddy designs [...] of free social icons Social Network Icon Pack \u00b7 Komodo Media 39 Amazing New Social Media Icon Sets 40 Free High Quality Hand-drawn Fonts 20+ High-Quality Free Fonts for Retro and Vintage [...] http://www.oh-sweet.de/2009/07/05/suning-5/ Suning #5 | Oh!Sweet.BloG [...] 4) 40 Free High Quality Hand-drawn Fonts [...] http://www.GraphicHorizon.net Wallpapers Thanks for sharing , Really Cool http://www.techawe.com/2009/07/05/weekly-webtrends-3/ Weekly WebTrends #3 | TechAwe [...] 40 Free High Quality Hand-drawn Fonts | Graphics Power Tips For WordPress Template Developers | Developer\u2019s Toolbox | Smashing [...] http://www.teratips.com teratips good and appreciating ZC (may be wrong) but I\u2019m counting 39 fonts, not 40.. :s ZC Anyway, I donwload \u2018em all. 39 fonts.

I'm begining to think there isn't anything you can't cook in the crockpot. If you need to roast a bunch of veggies to bring to a potluck, or if you like to use roasted vegetables in other dishes and would like an entire pot full---you can save yourself the trouble of manning the oven. Roast them in your handy dandy crockpot.The Ingredients:--Vegetables. I happened to use brussel sprouts, green beans, baby carrots and some mushrooms because that's what I had in the crisper drawer. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that any vegetable can be cooked this way. If you find something that can't (like I'm thinking maybe artichokes, but I also have two lovely artichokes in the fridge, so maybe I'll try to prove myself wrong proving myself wrong sometime this week) please let me know.--olive oil--kosher salt--pepperThe Directions:--wash and trim veggies--put into the crockpot still moist--drizzle olive oil over the top (1T? 2T? I didn't measure)--healthy pinch of salt and pepper--toss with hands to coat vegetables evenly with oil and spices--yell across the house for someone to come turn on the faucet so you can wash your handscover and cook on low for 4 hours, high for 2-3. Stir every hour or so and check vegetable tenderness. The ones pictured above are a bit over-cooked. We brought them over to my mom's for the Super Bowl and ate them about 2 hours later than we should have. I turned them to warm when they were \"finished\"---but they changed consistency even on the warm setting. The crispy al dente-ness was still there, but the color drained more than I would have liked.

February 5, 2008 6:47 AM Penguins13 said... you can do artichokes in the CP. That is the only way I have ever cooked them. Just stuff and add a tiny bit of olive oil and some water. Cook on low for a couple hours until done (4 maybe, never timed it). Serve with Oil and Vinegar. Yumm! February 5, 2008 7:57 AM Melissa said... Hmm, there are so many things that I didn't know you could do in a slow cooker. I'm going to be getting a lot of use out of this one. February 5, 2008 8:52 AM Crockpot Lady said... kay, that sounds like a great combination.melissa, I know! My mind is blown, too!penguins, I don't get it. How do you stuff artichokes? Do you mean stuff them in the crockpot, or cut the end off and actually stuff them with something?I am confused. February 5, 2008 8:56 AM Canadian Saver said... Yum, I agree this is something that could be done when it's really hot and you don't want to heat up the house. I'm thinking there would be so many combinations possible with yummy garden veggies! February 5, 2008 9:02 AM Penguins13 said... CL, I cut the stem off the artichoke, peel it and cut it into spears. Then I cut the pointy ends off the arti leaves and whack it on the counter to sort of open the leaves a bit. Then you make a breadcrumb stuffing, I used Olive oil, Parmesan cheese, garlic and some lemon juice. It should be a tiny bit moist, so that it sticks together. Then put the stuffing into the opened leaves. Sometimes I will remove the the leaves in the very center and stuff that too. It is really good. You should try it. February 5, 2008 12:34 PM Penguins13 said... forgot to add that you use the stem spears and stick them into some of the leaves to allow more stuffing room February 5, 2008 12:36 PM Crockpot Lady said... woah. I have never thought of doing anything like that, ever! I am so intrigued. We already have dinner planned for tonight, so I'm going to have to wait for tomorrow. thank you! February 5, 2008 12:43 PM Amy said... dude...I think you've proved you can do anything with your crockpot...LOL February 5, 2008 6:31 PM Rebecca said... \"--toss with hands to coat vegetables evenly with oil and spices--yell across the house for someone to come turn on the faucet so you can wash your hands\"I think you've been spying on us! :PAlthough sometimes I call my husband in and make him toss them, because I haaaate the feeling of olive oil on my hands. January 18, 2010 4:59 PM bostonred said... I bet I can sleep an extra hour on Thanksgiving now! It normally takes me a few hours to roast all the veggies I want to in the oven -now I can just throw them in the big crockpot! My new little crock will have green bean casserole. I may resurrect the really old crock for dressing. Thanks for the great idea. November 21, 2010 6:12 AM Post a Comment Thank you for your comment!

Stella Terrill Mann Collaborative/cooperative learning \u25c4 Group projects Active Listening Conflict resolution Peer mediation Tutoring guidelines Using feedback and working with tutors Cooperative or collaborative learning is a team process where members support and rely on each other to achieve an agreed-upon goal.\u00a0 The classroom is an excellent place to develop team-building skills you will need later in life. Cooperative/collaborative learning is interactive;as a team member, you: develop and share a common goal contribute your understanding of the problem:questions; insights and solutions respond to, and work to understand, others' questions, insights and solutions.Each member empowers the other to speak and contribute,and to consider their contributions are accountable to others, and they are accountable to you are dependent on others, and they depend on you What makes for a good learning team? Team activities begin with training in, and understanding group processes.An instructor begins by facilitating discussion and suggesting alternativesbut does not impose solutions on the team, especially those having difficulty working together Three to five peopleLarger teams have difficulty in keeping everyone involved Teacher-assigned groupsThey function better than self-assigned groups Diverse skill levels, backgrounds, experience Each individual brings strengths to a group Each member of the group is responsible to not only contribute his/her strengths, but also to help others understand the source of their strengths Any member who is at a disadvantage or not comfortable with the majority should be encouraged and proactively empowered to contribute Learning is positively influenced with a diversity of perspective and experienceincreasing options for problem solvingexpanding the range of details to consider Commitment of each member to a goal that is defined and understood by the group Confidential peer ratings are a good way to assess who is and who is not contributing Groups have the right to fire a non-cooperative or non-participating member if all remedies have failed.\u00a0(The person fired then has to find another group to accept him/her) Individuals can quit if they believe they are doing most of the work with little assistance from the others.\u00a0\u00a0(This person can often easily find another group to welcome his/her contributions) Shared operating principles and responsibilities, defined and agreed to by each member.\u00a0 These include:\u00a0 Commitment to attend, prepare and be on time for meetings Have discussions and disagreements focus on issues, avoiding personal criticism Take responsibility for a share of the tasks and carry them out on timeYou may need to perform tasks that you have little experience, feel ill-prepared for, or even think others would do better.\u00a0 Accept the challenge, but be comfortable in stating that you may need help, training, a mentor, or have to resign and take on different task. Process: Refer to the Group Project Guide Set up goals, define how often and with what means you will communicate, evaluate progress, make decisions, and resolve conflict Define resources, especially someone who can provide direction, supervision, counsel, and even arbitrate Schedule review of your progress and communicationto discuss what is working and what is not working Teams with problems should be invited or required to meet with the instructor to discuss possible solutions. *\u00a0 \"Cooperative learning\" is often used in K-12 education, and \"collaborative learning\" in higher education See also:\u00a0 Online Collaborative Learning in Higher Education, primary sitesa web site devoted to world's best practice in online collaborative learning in higher education, and related topics.\u00a0 Tim Roberts, Faculty of Informatics and Communication, Central Queensland University, Bundaberg, Queensland 4670 Australia \"Cooperative learning in technical courses: procedures, pitfalls, and payoffs\", Richard M.

Which Social Networks are Right for You? Posted on March 28, 2011 by Mash Bonigala | Posted in Marketing We all have heard that social networking is the wave of the future when it comes to small business. However, there are so many social networks that it is literally possible to spend all day on them and forget all about the objectives of your company. This means that the smart business owner has to prioritize their social media activities. What networks are right for you? How involved should you be on them? Here are a few things to think about when setting your social networking priorities. There is strength in numbers. Because it takes people to be social\u2014and the more people, the better in most cases\u2014you should consider the size of different social media sites before investing too much time and typing into them. At the time of this writing, Facebook has more than 110 million users while LinkedIn has 30 million and Twitter has 5 million. Size isn\u2019t everything, but it is nonetheless an important factor. Demographics are important. MySpace has more than twice the number of users than Facebook, but it didn\u2019t even merit a mention in the previous paragraph. Why? Because it\u2019s no longer a credible social network for small businesses. LinkedIn on the other hand, may be small, but it is home to the social profiles of Bill Gates and other Fortune 500 CEO\u2019s. Facebook comes in second when it comes to credibility, with a respectable mixture of business and pleasure. Invest where it will pay off. Some social networks are not likely to last long, especially not in the current economic climate. You can guess that Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook will be here next week, because they have a business model that works and a large following. However, some social media sites are too new to meet the challenges of our economy, while others have insufficient income for their growth rate. There is a lot of potential in newer social networks, but the established ones offer stability that can\u2019t be beat. Similarly, the older, more established social networks have higher page ranks on the most used search engines. They can give you a more substantial web presence than their lower ranked peers. Be a team player. Once you have selected the right network or networks, you need to participate in them in a fair manner, responding to other people\u2019s posts and posting interesting information. Sticking to commercial material alone will weed your network to almost nobody and severely annoy whoever is left. Maintain your social networking accounts on a regular (like, daily) basis and keep an interesting mix of posts. This will help you build a large sphere of influence and also give people who are new to your company a great first impression. Set a daily time for social media. This is the best way to make sure you manage your social networks and not the other way around. Set a finite time period every day to be dedicated to updating and maintaining your social networks. Other than that, leave them alone and go about your business. You may need to experiment to come up with a system that works, but in the long run you will find the balance that you deserve.

That's my plan for this blog post. To share with you three custom reports that I find to be super valuable when I am doing web data analysis. Not only will I tell you about them, I'll give you downloadable links so you can get going right away! I must forewarn you that my hidden agenda is also to expose to you metrics you might not be using, views of data that you might be ignoring, best practices that are of value and teach you how to fish. Consider yourself fully forewarned! I love custom reports. They allow us to step away from the oppression of standard reports (/data pukes) and bring an increased amount of relevancy, calm and focus to our day-to-day work and to our beloved data consumers. If your daily practice of web analysis does not hugely rely on custom reports (and advanced segments) then I am afraid you might be a lot more in the Reporting Squirrel mold and a lot less in the Analysis Ninja mold. Sorry. With that motivational speech, :), below are three custom reports that are of incredible value. You can use them as is, or, better still, you can download and adapt them to your unique business needs. Either way I promise you'll deliver actionable insights faster! [While I am using Google Analytics here, you can do custom reporting in pretty much any tool you have access to, be it Yahoo! Web Analytics or Site Catalyst or WebTrends.] #1: Page Efficiency Analysis Report. I am often irritated by how fractured page level reporting is. Four or six or ten reports that all tell you how your website pages are doing, except that you don't know which report to use and what the heck to do. So you, and I, do nothing. Faith rules. My goal was to create one single report for you that would serve as a valuable starting point for page analysis for any type of website, especially a content rich non-ecommerce website. Here it is. . . Optimally, to judge a page you'll look at three different pieces which are often not on the same report or not in any standard report. We fix that above. First, what we want to know is: How often does this page act as our home page (Entrances) and how well is it doing its job (Bounces)? I like reporting by Page Title (hopefully you are good at SEO and have taken care of this). I can quickly see which pages have high/horrible bounce rates. In an instant I know which pages need emergency surgery. [For the minority of you who believe high bounce rates are ok, I encourage you to see this post: http://zqi.me/akbounce I especially recommend reading comments #153, #157 & #164. Thanks.] Second, we worry about content consumption: How many Unique Visitors came, how many page views were generated and what content was more consumed more / less? A lot of focus is on measuring Visits, which in this case I don't find to be of any value. I want to know how many People (approximated by Unique Visitors, plus or minus a few) saw a piece of content. Pageviews gives me a great proxy for knowing how often they might have seen it (not surprisingly more than once for my looooooong blog posts!). The final metric in this bucket \u2013 and this is lovely \u2013 focuses on which pieces of content are really consumed. I write really long posts; it is gratifying that people spend 14 minutes reading one, but I can also easily see posts/topics people just skip (not good!). Super awesome right? Third, (the part almost everyone ignores), \"show me the money!!!!\": What value was created by the content for our business? And by business I also mean non-profit, university, newspaper, government websites and chicken farmers! I don't care about page views if I am not making money / adding value to my non-profit or university. The data in the last two columns shows-pay attention please-differences in value created (for you!) when that piece of content was consumed. Per visit goal value column shows ultimately how much a page might have influenced impact on your business during a visit where someone viewed that page. So People who see Page 2 end up creating 0.82 value for you, and People who see Page 3 end up creating $1.15 worth of value. Hence content on Page #3 was more valuable to your users and your business during this time period. I like having Total Goal Completions because sometimes raw $ value hides insights. For example see pages #3 and #4. See what I mean? Initial job greatness, consumption / \"engagement\", and value delivered to your business. Do you know this about your content? Here's how you can get this report: Log into Google Analytics. Come back here. Now click on this link Page Efficiency Analysis Report. It will open in Google Analytics. Click on the Create Report button and it will save it in your account. If you want to share this report with others (say via Twitter / email) you can use this url: http://zqi.me/akpage Bonus Items: You'll note that I have pre-built two drill downs into this report. If you click on the Page Title you'll see Visitor Type (New vs. Returning). I like to see for my great / awful pages if the behavior and data differs for those two segments. Then I like to drill down by City, again to see deltas. But you can change this to anything you want. Remember you can apply segmentation (oh yesss!) to this report. Scroll all the way to the top of the report. Click the drop down next to Advanced Segments. Click on Mobile Traffic (or whatever) and. . . Boom! Mobile page efficiency analysis! Sweetness. If you have an Ecommerce website you can replace Per Visit Goal Value with Per Visit Value and Total Goal Completions with Transactions. If seven metrics seem to be too much to analyze click on the Comparison icon on top of the table (in Google Analytics) and you'll magically get this: An easy peasy fast way to compare two metrics of most value to you and quickly identify the winners and losers. In this case I am answering a common question: Which content is consumed the most by People on my site and of that content which is most \"engaging,\" i.e. cause them to read all of it? Play with this feature; it is to die for. Change the pairings. Faster insights, guaranteed. #2: Visitor Acquisition Efficiency Analysis Report. We tend to be far too obsessed about Search Engines and Twitter and the Next Shiny Object. Or we are organized by silos. Daniel's responsible for email and Gemma's responsible for Bing and Harun's responsible for display. They never talk (there is no incentive to). There are a ton of reports of course. But everyone's optimizing for their local maxima rather than for the global maxima. Hate that. My goal was to create one report where I can review the efficiency and performance across all streams of traffic to the site. Paid media (PPC, Display etc), Earned media(Social Media), and Free media (SEO, Referring Sites etc). I don't want the Next Shiny Object nor the Current HiPPO Obsession to drive our acquisition strategy. Here's the report that is a fabulous starting point. . . Let's break down a report you are soon not going to want to live without. :) First, it shows all traffic sources. This is key. Organic and paid search, direct traffic, Twitter and Facebook, Facebook display ads, email marketing, top referring sites etc etc. No more silos! One place to judge how all streams perform. No egos. Second, we focus on input metrics: How many sessions (Visits) by how many Unique Visitors and how many existing vs. new? Senior folks seem to love Visits; I find them harmless. I really care about People. So one column for each of us. Are your marketing dollars chasing visits from people who have already visited your site, rather than prospects? New Visits to the rescue. For example notice the delta between Facebook ads vs. Facebook referrals. Ouch. Cute to know this key performance metric, right? Third, this one's really important: How many people engage in behavior we value? Typically you would look at metrics like Average Time on Site or Page Views per Visit. In this context why not use something significantly more insightful? I have created a Goal for the site where anyone who spends more than x amount of time or sees more than y number of pages is really giving me a precious gift: their attention. Regardless of whether they buy or submit a lead or do anything else of value, for me it's success. Looking at this Goal, rather than Avg Time on Page, is significantly more insightful in judging the initial blush of success. You see even if these people don't buy on the website they might buy offline. Or even if they don't donate or download, they'll at least be much better aware of my brand. Or even if my acquisition campaign (Paid, Earned or Free) did not result in conversion in this visit, maybe they'll come back later. Use this type of clever behavioral goal measurement rather than Avg Time / Pages. [Important: When you download this report, below, this column might have a zero or show something incorrect - if you have Goal 6 defined. To use the smart strategy I am recommending you'll have to 1. work with your business leaders to identify what \"engaged\" behavior is in your case is, 2. create a goal for it and then 3. add that to the report you'll download here, then 4. celebrate.] Fourth, outcomes baby! How much business value was added. I don't have to teach you the value of using Conversion Rates and Goal Values. The whole point of this report is to prioritize our focus. A vein should have popped in your head when you saw the conversion rates between google/cpc and google/organic. Good lord! You can quantify that your Twitter earned media efforts yield 21 cents of extra value for every visit when compared to Facebook earned media efforts, and a shocking 62 cents more than your efforts with Facebook display ads! OMG. Will that help you prioritize your efforts better? As Sarah would say: You betcha! Fifth, this is very important: What did it cost you to get this traffic to your site? This column in the report will often be zero. If your AdWords account is linked to Google Analytics perhaps you'll see Cost here. But most of the time it will be zero. I still want you to have it. Just to remind yourself, and your decision makers, that not all these rows have the same cost to bring that traffic to your site, to get it to engage and finally deliver the value you see in the Outcomes column. Often we de-prioritize Earned Media and Free Media in favor of Paid Media (it seems sexy). That column is to encourage you to get cost numbers, even rough ones, and then, you'll do this in Excel, add something like Cost Per Conversion or Cost Per Visitor to the report (in Excel). Then and only then will your company be making the smartest possible decisions. Remember no acquisition is free. Even \"Free Media\", it just costs less. It is your job to identify that and make your company smarter. Are you providing this view of Acquisition Efficiency to your HiPPO's? Here's how you can get this report: Log into Google Analytics. Come back here. Now click on this link Acquisition Efficiency Analysis Report. It will open in GA. Click on the Create Report button and it will save it in your account. If you want to share this report with others (say via Twitter / email) you can use this url: http://zqi.me/akvisitor Bonus Items: You'll note that I have pre-built two drill downs into this report. If you click on the Source/Medium you'll drill down to Medium. For your email / search / display / social media / video / whatever else campaigns you'll now see the next level of detail (banner ad or rich media ad or. . .). If you click on Medium you'll drill down to Campaign Name (certain size, duration, destination, promo code, whatever you have coded). So you can hold all your $$$ accountable. If you have an Ecommerce website replace the Goal Conversion Rate metric with Conversion Rate and Per Visit Goal Value with my favorite Average Value. As with the above report you can apply segmentation to this report (please do!) and you can also use the Comparison view and, another love of mine, Advanced Table Filtering. Faster insights, and massive increase in hugs and kisses, guaranteed! #3: Paid Search Performance Analysis Micro-Ecosystem!\u00a0 Allow me to kvetch for a second.\u00a0 I pull my hair out, and a small part of my soul dies, every time I log into someone's Omniture or Google Analytics or Unica NetInsight account. For the thing that greets me is a massive data puke. Tons and tons of reports created for God knows what reason. They are the bubonic plague of our existence. It is as if our lives were not miserable enough with the 80 or 100 standard reports we have no idea what to do with. Now those not savvy in the first place about Visits and Visitors have to wade through even more irrelevant nonsense. I have championed the elimination of standard reports (who the heck is \"standard\" anyway? you?) and instead advanced the creation of focused custom \"micro-ecosystems\" that 1. reduce the number of reports 2. provide a one-stop destination for most answers on one topic, and finally, most importantly, 3. are hyper relevant. Here are the three steps to creating a self contained micro-ecosystem of relevant data: STEP 1: Identify & understand who will consume the data. STEP 2: You are not going to believe this. . ., talk to them (!) to understand their needs and success criteria. STEP 3: Insert two ounces of your raw brain power. What do they need, beyond what they want? That's it. I know it sounds simple. Trust me everything below is easy (actually I am going to give you the report for free!), the steps above are really hard. The micro-ecosystem I have created for you is to analyze the performance of a Paid Search Marketing program. The above examples have been non-ecommerce; this one is focused on ecommerce. There are three key parties I need to satisfy (as might be the case in your company). The SEM team, who actually spend all the paid search marketing budget day-to-day. The second party is the person who owns the website (Director). Finally the VP of Digital who is responsible for all the spend, across multiple efforts. Following my three step process above I have noted what each party wants, and, this is important, I have, from my experience, identified what they need. Here is the micro-ecosystem. . . piece number one. . . Everyone in the company goes to just one report to analyze the performance of the paid search campaigns. When they log in they choose their relevant tab. It's that simple. The first tab is focused on the SEM team. Four metrics on this page are what they directly asked for, things they watch every day, things their bonus depends on. I have added two more from my experience to prompt good behavior (Bounce Rate) and tie them to the bottom-line (Average Value). First, we look at the \"input.\" How many ad impressions were served? How did our ad perform in terms of Click-thru Rate? The team obsesses about this. Match types. Ad Copy. Quality Score. Ad Position. Campaign Structure. Search query. So many things in play, this is where you find out where to start looking for problems. Second, we look at activity. It is exceedingly rare that the SEM team (or, even worse, the Search Agency) is responsible for Bounce Rate. I think this is criminal. They can't just be responsible for spending money and dumping traffic on the site. However painful, they have to work with the site owner to ensure landing page relevancy, ad message consistency from Bing/Google to website and quality of their ad targeting. This humble metric is to force them to do that. Third, I am sure you see a theme in all my work, outcomes! The team cares about Cost Per Click and total Cost. Give 'em that. But you'll be shocked that most of the time they don't care about conversions. So I add Average Value (essentially Average Order Size) so they can see which keywords to focus on more or less (see the range above from 82 to 211!) and not just clickthru rate, etc. The SEM team / Agency will do lots of other reporting and segmentation and deep dive analysis. But they now have a simple and effective starting point. Next up. . . the person who owns the process after the traffic shows up. This might be different in each company, but typically the website is owned by one person. Here is their tab. . . on the exact same report! We shift our focus quite a bit as we move to the Director / Site Owner. They don't care about all the upfront stuff. They care about what's happening under their responsibility. First, we focus on how many Visits occurred and what kind of Visitors they were? Specifically are we attracting just the same old visitors we have always seen or is our money being spent optimally to attract new people to our site? Percentage of New Visits is here as a conversation starter between the Director & the SEM Team / Agency. Second, what's happening on the website? Are the entry home pages great? Bounce rate is a joint responsibility. Then it is important to realize that sadly not everyone will convert (boo!). I have chosen Pages per Visit as a proxy for an activity of value completed by the Visitor to the site. We know what the Average Pageview per Visit is; this column tells us if by keyword the difference, and if people don't bounce do they connect with our content? If not then why not? As a Director that is my job to figure out. Third, surely my neck is on the line for ensuring that money (lots of it) is being produced. Hence the Revenue column. It takes less than ten seconds of eyeballing to figure out where there is a mismatch between crowds of visits and a mass of revenue (or not), and between non-bounce content consumption and revenue production. Sweetness. One report. We are all on the same page! The SEM team is probably logging into the system all day long; the Director perhaps a few times a week; the VP of Digital probably just a few times a month. But when She/He does they'll go to the exact same report and click on Her/His tab. Here's what they'll see. . . [Note: Here are things good Analysis Ninja's worry about. You'll notice Impressions in all three personalized tabs. The Director and VP don't really care about this metric. It is there as an \"anchor.\" Whichever tab you go to the data will always be sorted the same! Tiny detail, but it matters so much.] The VP is greeted with a lot fewer metrics (remember: always fewer relevant metrics!). First, they might pay a cursory glance at the summary view provided in the scorecard(which will be on top of the above report but I have cropped for clarity). They do care about traffic. Just seeing the sorting of the Visits, in context of the Impressions, will give them pause. Note the questions that might pop up, even to a VP, as you compare the queries \"accuracy vs. precision\" and \"kaushik\".\u00a0 Or \"customer service questions.\" What is up with that? Second, VPs care about cost and they care about productivity. These are two columns they use to praise you and get you and themselves a bonus. What is the Cost per Click and, for that expense, what is the Revenue per Click? I don't have to tell you what to do with these two columns. Love them a lot. Third, VPs care about their bonus. Sorry, I mean they care about company revenue. :) Knowing RPC is important, having Revenue right there is fantastic context about overall achievement. You could have stuffed number of transactions or orders or conversion rate or all that other junk. You don't need to. Remember: fewer relevant metrics! Your effort into the three STEP process above pays off rich dividends by killing data pukes, focusing on what's important, and creating one destination for everyone to go to and for everyone to point to. It is so amazing when this works. Here's how you can get this report: Log into Google Analytics. Come back here. Now click on this link Paid Search Analysis Micro-Ecosystem. It will open in GA. Click on the Create Report button and it will save it in your account. If you want to share this report with others (say via Twitter / email) you can use this url: http://zqi.me/aksearcheco Bonus Items: If you click on the Keyword you'll drill down to Campaign. This is important because your campaign structure has so much influence on your ultimate performance. If you click on Campaign you'll drill down to Ad Group level (which needs constant love and caring). You can easily create a micro ecosystem for your Email campaigns. For your Social Media efforts. For your. . . any place your company is spending money. This report is for Ecommerce. It will work just fine if you're a non-profit or a government entity using AdWords or adCenter. Just swap the outcome metrics with ones mentioned in the first two reports. You can do segmentation, advanced table filtering and all other good stuff here. Do it. Extra Special Bonus Items: Except for the last report, you can create all the above reports in five minutes in any web analytics tool you are using. You will not need to touch the JavaScript tag or go on a date with the IT team or update the contract with your Paid Vendor. If you are using Omniture or CoreMetrics etc you can still create the third report in Excel. Please do. If you are using Google Analytics check out the delightful quick start guide to Custom Reporting. It covers designing, building and viewing a custom report. Tip: Check out the super useful graphic under Building Your Custom Report. You will fail at all the above reports if you have not identified your Goals and Goal Values. If you are starting from scratch use the Web Analytics Measurement Model to identify your Goals. If you need more tactical examples from different types of websites please refer to my blog post on Macro & Micro Conversions. Gentle reminder: No Goals, No Glory. I had a lot of fun creating these special reports for you. I hope you'll have just as much fun adapting them to your own companies and their unique needs. But most of all I hope you'll release your data customers from the tyranny of data pukes and irrelevant standard web analytics reports! Ok it's your turn now. Do you have a favorite custom report? Care to share a downloadable version with the super smart audience of Occam's Razor? Do you have some version of one of my reports above that is even better? Care to share that one? Incentive: The person who shares the best report will get a personalized signed copy of Web Analytics 2.0!\u00a0 Please share the report via comments, I know we all would love to benefit from your wisdom and experience. There were some wonderful reports submitted, please see the comments, but the one I loved the most was by Peter van Klinken [comment #41]. It was a very clever report and the use of pivot tables in GA was particularly cool. I'll be sending Peter a signed copy of W A 2.0. Thanks to all of you for the wonderful submissions.

It's exactly what I needed, but lacked the knowledge to create. You've certainly taken this blog to another level with this post! Sam Brown Says: December 6th, 2010 at 07:00 Excellent, excellent post \u2013 you probably provide the MOST useful content I have ever seen from a blog. Thank you so much \u2013 big fan! Josh Braaten Says: December 6th, 2010 at 07:07 Hi Avinash, Thanks for a great post as always. I really enjoy seeing your posts about custom reports because it's akin to asking a football commentator to pick his dream team. Seeing the superstar metrics you select together on one report give me a better appreciation for the sport of web analytics. My favorite custom report is my SEO Performance Report: (http://bit.ly/gf0opU), which gives me an idea for acquisition, engagement and outcomes for each keyword I'm targeted. I like to segment this based on the different topics I write about to see which blog posts are doing well with search and with my visitors. Finally, great suggestion on creating a custom engagement metric like people who have seen X pages. That helps steer the conversation towards creating more content that people find engaging. Thanks for a great Monday treat! Ankit Garg Says: December 6th, 2010 at 08:54 Excellent post Avinash and I have to agree with Daniel on putting this blog to another orbit with this post. Thanks for the custom reports. Nelson Yuen Says: December 6th, 2010 at 10:05 Great post as always Avinash. These custom reports are especially powerful for CRO experts that do extensive multivariate and A/B testing to improve page performance. Good report josh. I'm sure you set up your custom report with a dimension of \"Keyword\" because you aren't doing any PPC. For some people that would like to use Josh's report. I suggest substituting his DIMENSION of \"Keyword\" with \"Medium\" and then having GA drill down to the \"keyword.\" I believe the report is set up to combine both CPC and SEO into one dimension. Using \"medium\" as the main dimension of the report will show users which channels are completing the most goals, and then you can click either \"Organic\" or \"CPC\" to drill down to the keyword level. Paul Wood Says: December 6th, 2010 at 10:07 Excellent post! This is so helpful, I am constantly looking for ways to create the best reports for different people involved and never feeling like I can quite hit the nail on the head. These reports will go a long way to helping me out. Thanks for all of the hard work! Josh Braaten Says: December 6th, 2010 at 10:12 Hey thanks, Nelson! You're right in assuming I don't do any PPC for my blog. I'll typically include SEO or PPC in my segments when looking at reports with the keyword dimension. Great tip on modifying the report to be more universally helpful! Steven Alig Says: December 6th, 2010 at 10:19 Excellent post. Thank you for making me very aware of my squirrelyness. I now have so much more to do. \"I just need more time Captain!\" Nelson Yuen Says: December 6th, 2010 at 10:30 Here is Josh's report revised. It should allow you to look at Organic and Paid separately and then drill down (click on \"Organic\" or \"CPC\" based on what you want to look at). http://bit.ly/dHyNAd Happy Holidays everyone. Devin Poolman Says: December 6th, 2010 at 11:05 These are great Avinash \u2013 thank you. Although when I click the link to add them, it appears that I'm forced to add the report to the first account/profile that comes up (I have access to numerous GA accounts). I tried switching over to my specific account and profile first, but that doesn't seem to help. Avinash Kaushik Says: December 6th, 2010 at 11:14 Devin: Great point! Indeed it will add to the default. But at the bottom of the page you land on (custom report creation page) you'll see this: Visible in: http://www.kaushik.net and 0 other profiles. [The name of the website you'll see won't be kaushik.net but rather the site you are logged into.] Click on the \"0 other profiles\" button and you'll be able to save the report to any profile you want the report to be visible in. Check the ones you want and hit Save. You can also later add and remove which sites see the report by checking or unchecking the relevant box. Josh & Nelson: Thank you for adding your custom reports. I am sure our blog readers will find them to be of value! -Avinash. Cleo Parker Says: December 6th, 2010 at 11:27 This is great! Great insights to see these data all on the same page. Devin, if you edit the report at the bottom there's an option to add it to the other sites in your profile. Raghu Kashyap Says: December 6th, 2010 at 11:58 Yet again you amaze everyone with simplicity and analysis impact. The above reports makes great dashboard and yet it is really simple. I really love the advanced segmentation piece that you can apply to any of the reports in GA. I am however, unable to find a similar capability in WebTrends. Pavlicko Says: December 6th, 2010 at 13:40 Nice reports Avinash! Here's mine: Visits by City > Medium > Source/Medium > Keyword http://www.google.com/analytics/reporting/edit_custom_report?share=CXOdvSwBAAA.5cmZVfTgv7FSDQaf3SApcHCbjnyHJ_psOjRWQ0_WK-oLZULHIW9KNbvp6AYABO5r29gb5Z69hwSvKeD4gMLUAQ.PPNPPxBZWb89OzadPPWB5A Super simple, yet very insightful \u2013 made much more powerful when combined with advanced segments or even advanced filters. I wish more people would share their reports! Chief Alchemist Says: December 6th, 2010 at 16:28 Great post! Thanks for sharing the custom reports. About the only thing I would suggest others consider is using URL Builder to tag any outgoing links. If done properly you'll get much more granular data. For example, was the traffic from Twitter from the link on the profile page, or a post link. How traffic came from employee email signatures, etc. These are all great reports that would benefit from that add level of detail. Chief Alchemist Says: December 6th, 2010 at 16:41 p.s. I just realized I have you Web Analytics \u2013 An Hour Per Day. If fact, I emailed you a couple questions once :) As luck would have it, I read a bit of it but then go distracted. (Sorry.) I'm gearing up to start again. If you don't mind I try to blog one tip per chapter. This let's me share a bit of what I've learned but also ideally creates interest in the book. Thanks again! Judd Exley Says: December 6th, 2010 at 17:36 Awesome Sauce. I always love the validation that I'm rockin' some Custom Reports when mine already look like yours. Any more though, I've found that the biggest step in creating any report is simply getting a client to be interested in/understand them. Where's the download for that?!? haha. Joey Dorrington Says: December 6th, 2010 at 18:09 Thanks Avinash, and thanks to everyone sharing their reports. True, they are far more powerful when you apply custom segments. Jon Whitehead Says: December 6th, 2010 at 19:10 \"Thanks\" seems a bit inadequate \u2013 but thanks Avinash \u2013 there is much fun to be had with custom reports and switching around metrics and views. I like this line as its so true: \"But everyone's optimizing for their local maxima rather than for the global maxima.\" Hear, hear \u2013 holistic view rules! Avinash Kaushik Says: December 6th, 2010 at 21:57 Judd: I realize you are part kidding but it is an important problem. One way to attack the issue is to focus on the business questions, more context in this blog post: ~ Rebel! Refuse Report Requests. Only Answer Business Questions, FTW Another path, that works frequently is to have a Web Analytics Measurement Model upfront. The clients and business leaders are most definitely interested then because your analysis is 100% based on what they actually prioritize. Mark: Great reminder. Without the links properly tagged I think all three reports would be much much worse looking than they are in the screenshots! Thanks, Avinash. Julian Haber Says: December 6th, 2010 at 22:01 Thank you for your post. I've been reading your blog for over a year. Always enjoyable and informative. Hubert Says: December 7th, 2010 at 06:36 Avinash, great post ! I was not aware that we could easily share a report to everyone. I looked at Josh's report and found it very useful except that for some websites, we have an important traffic coming through paid search. I wanted to split keywords from natural and paid search. That's why I added the \"support\" dimension before the keywords to easily drill down to this level. The report is available here : http://tiny.cc/coyim Do not hesitate to comment it ! Finally, I have a practical question for Google Analytics : is it possible to duplicate the tab of a report in order to do just small changes form one view to another ? Thanks for the answer. Anthony Centeno Says: December 7th, 2010 at 08:43 Very helpful stuff Avinash! I already have several ideas on creating micro eco-system reports for product categories or multiple stakeholders. Thanks again, Anthony Zach Says: December 7th, 2010 at 10:33 When I make a custom report with the dimension being campaign and the metric impressions, clicks, CPC, etc. I don't see any of that data in the report, all I see is visits, time on site, etc. I can click over to traffic sources > adwords > campaigns and then under the Click tab see all the adwords data, so I know that AdWords is tracking in Analytics. Why won't these adwords metrics show up in my custom report? Any help? Nelson Yuen Says: December 7th, 2010 at 14:03 Hey Zach, I hope the community feels free to chime in with me if I'm wrong, but I suspect that the reason why you don't see \"impressions,\" \"CTR,\" \"CPC,\" is that impressions aren't counted when you are looking at \"all of your campaigns.\" In other words, if \"campaign\" is your dimension, what GA wants to do is measure the performance of your advertising channels as an aggregate to \"visits\" or \"page views.\" Impressions is only relevant to PPC campaigns and specific \"keywords\" or \"ad groups.\" So what you will want to do is specify \"adgroup\" to the dimension or \"keyword\" should work for you as well. Joey Dorrington Says: December 7th, 2010 at 16:26 Here are a few of the reports I use on a daily/weekly/monthly basis. SEM Analysis \u2013 http://bit.ly/fXkHV6 Source Analysis \u2013 http://bit.ly/ihkitq And the last one is my favorite. It pulls some key metrics that I like to track on a day by day basis. I then export this data into Excel and make dynamic charts to chart each of the individual metrics. I even overlay marketing inputs to measure the effects of difference kinds of marketing activities. Daily analysis \u2013 http://bit.ly/dI9ZAa Enjoy Chris Schwarz Says: December 7th, 2010 at 17:25 Great detailed post Avinash \u2013 all the comments we almost better than it! Ive taken your Input, Onsite Activity and Output framework and made them into some custom reports IOO by Country \u2013 http://bit.ly/fH2RXz IOO by Days Since Last Visit \u2013 http://bit.ly/iklKb1 IOO by Browser \u2013 http://bit.ly/eRa14m I find that simple and easy to use. I like you idea of combining an engagement goal to be X pages/visit OR Y time on site. Frederik Says: December 8th, 2010 at 00:35 Want free awesome GA reports? Don't mind if I do! Thanks, I'll digg in to them today! Slava Says: December 8th, 2010 at 01:12 Nice reports, thanks for sharing your best ideas. Avinash Kaushik Says: December 8th, 2010 at 12:34 Chris: Thanks for adding your submissions. It shows how easy it is to create reports that are most relevant to one business. I appreciate your kind words about, what you framed, my I O O framework. I have consistently found it works. In your reports you have it on three tabs, making it easier for everyone to see what they want. If your company has a web analytics measurement model I suspect you could even distill them all down to one tab and just the critical few metrics. -Avinash. PS: Very clever to use the Visits metric as the common \"anchor\" across all three tabs! Oz Says: December 8th, 2010 at 15:58 Avinash, what a great post, I always enjoy and learn a lot from them. The information about each report and how we can actually use them on our sites so dynamically is just awesome. I use GA, and I set the goals, but for some weird reason they do not report correctly on GA, on the content report I get a xxx amount of visits and on the goals says zero, like no one got to my page. Lee Says: December 9th, 2010 at 06:13 Great post Avinash thanks for the reports. Although I seem to have encountered a problem with the paid search report and wondered if anyone else had experienced similar when reporting impressions. I saved the report to my profile on Tuesday and all the data was being populated as expected. I have then returned to the report today to find it is no longer populating impressions. If I change date and view before or on tuesday 7th Dec they all appear fine, I've checked the ad words account and the campaigns are still running with impressions being counted? We did make a small change on Tuesday to remove an ad words conversion goal, but this shouldn't effect impressions should it, besides like I mention above the ad words data appear ok. Thought? Aaron Says: December 9th, 2010 at 06:14 Great post! What criteria did you use for selecting which pages to include in #1: Page Efficiency Analysis Report? Gill Says: December 9th, 2010 at 09:16 Cracking post, Avinash! Paid Search Eco system has been well and truly adopted in my accounts. I wanted to share one I find really useful on a regular basis: Content Diagnosis: http://bit.ly/gkI9Xu It's all about the drill down here: - top-level: identify the pages with issues - 1st drill-down: identify the medium - 2nd drill-down: identify the keywords When optimising from different angles as an agency it gives us a great insight into where to focus on next, and how to approach making improvements (is the page content a good match for the keywords?, are the social media efforts mis-firing?, can the display ads tie in better to the on page messages [or go to a different page]). Essentially it helps me optimise the conversion process from end to end Avinash Kaushik Says: December 9th, 2010 at 10:16 Lee: I have just tried the report in three different accounts and it seems to work. I am unsure of what the issue might be in your account. I encourage you to work with a GAAC: http://bit.ly/gaac , there are many and they offer services at quite affordable rates. Aaron: The Page Efficiency Analysis Report is sorted by Entrances. Hence the pages listed are those that are \"home pages\" of the website (entry pages to the site). You will notice that I also have the metric Pageviews in the report. The delta between \"how many people enter on that page\" and \"how many people viewed the page at any time during their visit\" is quite valuable. If you want to look for particular page, amongst those on your site, you can use Advanced Filters at the bottom of the table in your report in Google Analytics. You can also use Advanced Segmentation. Gill: I love the Content Diagnosis Report! It is a very interesting way to look at data and drilling down into some root cause. Thank you for creating it. Avinash. Tristina Says: December 13th, 2010 at 04:30 I love custom reports. Thanks for sharing! Ravi Shanker Says: December 13th, 2010 at 04:31 \"Google Analytics Page Efficiency Analysis Report\" thanks for your step by step process\u2026 B\u00e9ate Vervaecke Says: December 13th, 2010 at 09:34 Thanks for these suggestion. I had a report like that, but I stopped using it when I saw weird data with the metric \"unique visitor\" and \"visits\" on a page level. There are more unique visitors then visits. Any idea why? Avinash Kaushik Says: December 13th, 2010 at 09:52 Beate: I would encourage you to work with a GAAC to isolate what the issue might be. Here's a list: http://bit.ly/gaac Unique Visitors should always be greater than or equal to Visits. Sometimes if the data model in the tool does not support it or sometimes if we slice things in a very odd way (I think think of me slicing data with, if I remember right, page across sessions where I also end up sometimes with odd data because I am slicing something illogical). I am not sure what might be up in your case but working with a GAAC will most certainly help you investigate this successfully. Avinash. James Holmes Says: December 14th, 2010 at 03:35 Great post, thanks. In reference to the second report \"Visitor Acquisition Efficiency Analysis report\" I was wondering the best way to exclude brand traffic. Would it be to set up a new profile with a filter just for this purpose and then create this custom report? Looking at these types of reports I find that brand traffic skews particularly the organic results (and maybe the cpc results too if bidding on brand terms). Excluding the influence of \"brand\" in my mind would help make this report even more actionable, i.e. where best to put marketing budget. Peter van Klinken Says: December 14th, 2010 at 06:13 Avinash, great reports. I use a report that specifies the different behavior between New and returning vistors. I use three categories as collumns: Traffic, Conversions, Events. When viewing this report i set it to a pivottable and pivot by Visitor Type. Then select the 2 stats you want to compare within the categorie tab you're in. Report: goo.gl/GKcwZ http://goo.gl/nvVta Screenshot pivot: http://goo.gl/Cv0Ie Avinash Kaushik Says: December 14th, 2010 at 14:03 James: Two words: Advanced Segmentation! It is quite easy to create an advanced segment for your non-brand traffic. Create that. Go to the Visitors Acquisition Efficiency report. Apply the segment and you are in business. Peter: Awesome! I love this very clever use of the pivot functionality in Google Analytics, something that is sadly underused. I also like the focus on Outcomes (my fav!). For some reason the report won't open for me (I can see the screenshot). Would you like to email me the complete link or perhaps try to send the link again in a url shortner? I would very much like to use the report. Thank you, -Avinash. Ankit Garg Says: December 15th, 2010 at 03:38 @Peter: Report is not opening for me as well though I can see the screenshot. Would you please post alternate URL for general good. :) Peter van Klinken Says: December 15th, 2010 at 04:07 Since the report link i posted previously didn't work.

Quick question \u2013 why do you use number of Bounces in the first post, rather than bounce rate %? Mayur Macwan Says: December 17th, 2010 at 23:54 Dear Avinash, This blog is the Bible of Web Analytics. If I dont read this post, or infact any, i cant survive (keep my faith) in the industry!. Awesome Awesome Awesome\u2026\u2026 You are right, \"These are the reports we dont want to live without\". Luca Bs Says: December 19th, 2010 at 02:11 Thanks a lot! It's a good and useful present for christmas! Avinash Kaushik Says: December 19th, 2010 at 05:55 Simon: Purely for visual impact reasons. Most people expect to see a % and when they see a huge, raw, number I find it gives them a pause. Then they ask questions! Sometimes it is good to give people a pause, no? :) Avinash. Ninja wannabe Says: December 19th, 2010 at 09:19 Hey Avinash,thanks for the great post! I am responsible for the digital marketing and analytics for a new online portal who's USP is original content. We are investing a lot in the content and hence want to make each content writer and editor accountable for the success/failure of their content. Thus, we land up with a peculiar problem of creating feature level reports attributable to each writer/editor. We are customizing wordpress CMS for most of our sites. Any tips to make my life better? Nelson Yuen Says: December 19th, 2010 at 09:45 Anyone else think it would be great to visit this blog over and over and create one big giant forum along with the quarterly blog posts? Avinash Kaushik Says: December 20th, 2010 at 01:12 Ninja Wannabe: In this case using Custom Variables is a great way to segment / report by author content. You can also then add additional variables or events to capture comments per post by author etc. You can work with a GAAC to help you create customized reporting for you using GA (if you are using GA). Here's a list: http://bit.ly/gaac Or work with the best consultant for other vendors. Finally the best way to get started with reporting off wordpress is to use Yoast's Blog Metrics plugin, it reports by author and gives some pretty amazing metrics. For free. http://yoast.com/wordpress/blog-metrics/ Avinash. Anil Kumar Singh Says: December 20th, 2010 at 06:06 Hi Avinash, It is Very informative report format. Need more on SEO report. Regards Anil Kumar Singh Jan de Vries Says: December 21st, 2010 at 00:46 Thanks for this amazing post! Love the long tail keyword segment. Segments I use are the Branded and Non-Branded search and Social Media. @Peter thanks for the report nice work, it gives me the inspiration to play some more with the pivot tables. @Avinash do you know a way to use advanced segments in the Visualization option (the graph in time with all the bulbs :)) Dekay Says: December 22nd, 2010 at 05:00 great post.. I wrote an entry about \"top landing pages\" in my own blog and now updated my blog post after reading your blog-\u2026 I used a report using your \"metrics\" but for Adobe Sitecatalyst awesome! thanx http://www.vandiene.com/2010/12/quick-fix-analysis-top-landing-pages/ Gustavo Says: December 24th, 2010 at 22:11 Thanks for your blog's postings.

Pablo Edwards Says: December 27th, 2010 at 05:40 Great post\u2026 You never cease to amaze me with your wisdom and insight. Dan Croxen-John Says: December 30th, 2010 at 04:39 Hi Avinash, A great post once again. I especially like the segmented reports for different folks, plus your focus on \"efficiency\". Too often we focus on achieving big results (or performance) without really considering the effort required to generate these results (or efficiency). One thing to add from my friend @danbarker is a way to remove \"All visits\" data. This is especially useful if you want to compare segments and the visits are being dwarfed by All Visits. Simply \"&seg0=-1\" from URL and press enter, and then you are left comparing advanced segments side by side. HTH Dan - \u2013 - \u2013 - [Dan's recommendation is to remove \"&seg0=-1\" from the url of report with multiple segments to remove the All Visits segment from the report. -Avinash] Avinash Kaushik Says: January 1st, 2011 at 08:34 Dan: Thanks for sharing the tip of taking out &seg0=-1 from the URL to remove All Visits and view only other selected segments. Unfortunately, perhaps the GA team has decided to punish me :), this does not work for me. Two problems. Many times &seg0 does not show up in the url, for example in the keyword report where I have applied two segments: https://www.google.com/analytics/reporting/all_sources?id=401908&pdr=20101201-20101231&cmp=average#lts=1293898812759 And when I tried on other reports where it does show up, the Visitor Trending report for Visits for example, removing &seg0 removes the two segments and only shows me All Visits. Bummer. You are absolutely right that it is supremely annoying that Google Analytics forces All Visits segment on you when you look at two segments (or more). I hope that one of these days this annoying problem will be fixed for good. Thanks for sharing the trick, I hope it works for others. Avinash. 3 onmisbare Google Analytics rapporten van Avinash Says: January 2nd, 2011 at 22:30 [...] Voor degene die het artikel rustig willen nalezen, aan te raden, bekijk het hier.

I have been using the basic reporting did not realize that there is so much more to analytics. In your Page Efficiency Analysis Report, you said we could replace Per Visit Goal Value with Per Visit Value and Total Goal Completions with Transactions, how can that be done. Please advice.. Avinash Kaushik Says: January 3rd, 2011 at 10:18 Steve: If you have saved the report then simply go to Custom Reports (in your right navigation), then look up the report you had saved, then click the Action called Edit, then choose the two metrics recommended from the left option were you see Metrics. The reason you would switch to Per Visit Value and Transactions is that you are a ecommerce website. So make sure your ecommerce tracking is set up and working fine (else you might see zeros in those columns). Avinash. Will Dobbs Says: January 3rd, 2011 at 16:00 Great reports!

Naveen Sanagala Says: January 7th, 2011 at 08:51 Thanks Avinash for sharing your web Analytics expertise with us. Nice blog\u2026 expecting more from you :) Matt Says: January 12th, 2011 at 07:03 Is there any reason why \"Cost\" in custom reports is so flaky? I've tried to hash it out and the only results I'm getting is that the \"Cost\" column (as well as all other Adwords data) will revert to $0.00 if you try to add certain metrics to your custom report. I will not see cost data on the \"Visitor Acquisition Efficiency Analysis\" report as set up by Avinash. But if I remove the \"Unique Visitors\" metric, then: voila, yummy cost data. Does anyone else get this result? Another metric that seems to to trigger this zeroing out of Adwords data is Unique Purchases\". There may be others\u2026 Adam Hermsdorfer Says: January 12th, 2011 at 20:42 Avinash, what a fun article! \"No goals, no glory\" \u2013 classic quote! I spent 45 minutes reading and going back and forth with my reports. Please keep blogging in '11, your expertise and humor really make web analytics fun! A. Land Says: January 13th, 2011 at 05:01 I'm fairly new to SEO and I've read a few of your articles so far. I end up spending at least a couple hours getting through each post because I keep pausing to follow other arcs of learning that were sparked by the content of your posts. Great stuff here! Luis Says: January 22nd, 2011 at 10:24 I have two different accounts on my access in analyitis, so when I click on the link to download the report it opens automatically on the account which I do not want. Then, when I change the account on the upper right box I changes to my Panel so I lose the possibility to create the report as yours.

You explain in such lucid manner that\u2019s quite amazing. Awesome Read. TW Says: February 10th, 2011 at 01:25 I love the page efficiency report but I did want to replace the goals with ecommerce revenues. No matter what metric I try, whether it's revenue, transactions, per visit value \u2013 they all end up with very inflated figures. Is it simply not possible to use this report in this way? I end up with 25,000 transactions for a period which should report 1,700. Join the conversation. . . .

If it\u2019s something like my mom\u2019s birthday or paying rent I\u2019m guaranteed to forget, but a slice of pizza I had during the Clinton administration will linger forever. And so it is with Spaghetti-os and our sordid history. Children, cover your eyes, this recipe will reveal quite a few things: I don\u2019t mind a couple of short cut ingredients when they get the job done. I\u2019m not above ordering food on the internet. I was a juvenile delinquent. I should have a job at the national vegan council for naming things. As a 14 year old goth in the age before cellphones, my friends and I would do that thing of staying up all night being idiots, hanging out on the beach or at the park or whatever (I swear it was mostly innocent.) Since we told our moms we were sleeping at each other\u2019s houses, we couldn\u2019t really go home until it was light out. \u00a0So we\u2019d go the corner store and pop a couple of Spaghetti-O cans for breakfast, thanks to that easy pull-off lid. We\u2019d pretty much sit on the street, black eyeliner streaming down our faces, ripped fishnets ripping even more, getting Spaghetti-o sauce all over our Salvation Army velvet dresses while we waited for the sun to rise. And, seriously, for shame, those Spaghetti-Os were good. Sort of mushy rings of pasta swimming in a sweet, cheesy sauce tomato sauce. And don\u2019t forget the meatballs! Chewy orbs that made you want to keep biting into them, even though you didn\u2019t exactly know why \u2013 it could have been voodoo or MSG. I had two basic strategies for extending their little meatball lives \u2013 slicing them in half or saving them for the end. You totally won if your last bite was a meatball. Well, sometimes my palate hits me with a strange craving, and I don\u2019t know if Sisters Of Mercy popped up on VH1 classics or what, but I had a nagging for vegan Spaghetti-os. The first order of business was to see if the O-shaped pasta could be found, which brought me to the Wikipedia list of pastas and eventually to Amazon where I purchased three bags of Anellini. I thought that the meatballs would work well with either tempeh or lentils (of course I had to ask Twitter first), but since I was out of tempeh, that answered that. And because I wanted mushy, but not TOO mushy, I added a little bit of vital wheat gluten. To make them addictive, some seasoned breadcrumbs and, since it\u2019s like catnip for vegans, a touch of nutritional yeast. The sauce was made velvety and cheesy with some cashews and nutritional yeast, but not too much. Instead of high fructose corn syrup, a bit of brown sugar caramelized with the onions gives the sauce a satisfying sweetness and cuts the bitterness of canned tomatoes. I also used crushed tomatoes with basil, for another dimension of sweetness. The end result hit all the right notes for me. The lentils ended up being the perfect choice for the chewy texture I wanted and their naturally meaty made for excellent meatballs. I really think kids of all ages will dig this. What kid won\u2019t want to eat something called Spaghetti-Nos? And not to toot my own horn or anything, but I\u2019m pretty sure they taste better than their inspiration. Maybe I didn\u2019t run outside and sit on the sidewalk to eat them, but I did wear a lot of black eyeshadow that evening. Coincidence? Recipe notes: ~If you can\u2019t find seasoned store bought breadcrumbs for the meatballs, add a pinch each of basil, oregano and thyme. Homemade bread crumbs won\u2019t work as well (too soft), but cracker crumbs might fare a bit better if you must. ~If you can\u2019t find crushed tomatoes with basil, just use a pinch or two of dried basil. ~If you don\u2019t have a food processor, you can still get the job done (although you\u2019ll need some sort of blender for the sauce.) Just get the onion grated and mash the lentils into a puree. If you warm them up a bit first they\u2019ll mush up a lot easier. ~To soak cashews, just submerge them in water for at least an hour and up to overnight. This softens them up and enables them to get really creamy. ~The recipe makes a lot! Feel free to halve it. And if you\u2019re short on time, just make the pasta or make the meatballs with regular sauce on regular pasta. It\u2019s fun to do the whole shebang, but all of the elements would be good solo players as well. ~Lastly, while it isn\u2019t difficult, this recipe does use quite a few pots and pans, so consider yourself warned! For time management purposes, start the sauce first and once it\u2019s simmering, begin the meatballs. That should get everything done within an hour. For the Cheesy Tomato Sauce: 2 teaspoons olive oil 1/2 cup finely chopped onion 3 cloves garlic, minced Fresh black pepper 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 1 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons packed brown sugar 2 24 oz. cans crushed tomato with basil 1/4 cup cashews, soaked (see note) 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast For the Mini Meatballs: 1 clove garlic 1 small onion, peeled (tangerine sized or equivalent) 1 1/2 cups cooked green or brown lentils, rinsed, drained (a 15 oz can is fine) 3 tablespoons nutritional yeast 2 tablespoons vital wheat gluten 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 tablespoon tomato paste 1 teaspoon olive oil 2 tablespoons water 1/2 cup seasoned store-bought breadcrumbs For everything else: 1 lb anellini pasta (or small pasta of your choice) Olive oil for pan frying To make the sauce: Preheat a 4 quart pot over medium heat. Sautee onions in olive oil with a pinch of salt until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic about a minute more, then mix in the black pepper, oregano, salt and brown sugar. Cook for about 2 minutes, until the sugar is melted. Add the tomato sauce, cashews and nutritional yeast, cover and cook for about 20 minutes. Now puree the sauce until smooth. It\u2019s easiest to use an immersion blender. You can also use a blender or food processor, blending in batches. Once it\u2019s smooth, keep warm in the pot until ready to use. To make the mini meatballs: We\u2019re going to use the food processor fit with a metal S blade for most of the work here, so it should come together pretty quickly. First toss in the garlic and pulse until finely chopped. Now add the onion and pulse until minced. You don\u2019t want any big pieces or they will ruin the texture of the meatball. With a plastic spatula, transfer the onion/garlic mixture to a mixing bowl and set aside. It\u2019s okay if some remnants are left, just try to get most of it. Now in the food processor, pulse the lentils, nutritional yeast, wheat gluten, soy sauce, tomato paste, olive oil and water. Once everything gets mixed well, puree them until totally smooth, scraping down the sides to make sure you get everything. Combine this mixture with the onion mixture and add in the breadcrumbs. Mix really well with your hands for about 2 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 F. Roll the meatballs into cherry sized balls, I got 32 meatballs out of this. This goes very fast if you keep your hands clean and dry (I was averaging one meat ball every 10 seconds.) Preheat a large skillet over medium heat and pour in a thin layer of olive oil. You don\u2019t want to crowd the pan, so pan fry in two batches. You should be able to tilt the pan and have all the meatballs roll around and get coated in oil, cooking until browned (no more than 5 minutes.) Transfer first batch to a baking pan, cook the second batch, and transfer all meatballs to the baking pan. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, shaking the pan every once in awhile to toss the balls so that they cook evenly. To assemble: Boil the pasta while the meatballs are cooking. Drain pasta, and add to the sauce. When meatballs are ready, add them to the sauce as well. Toss carefully with a wooden spoon, being careful not to break the meatballs. Serve!

March 28, 2011 at 7:35 pm: Jen This looks so super good, and the miniballz are too cute for words! What brand of breadcrumbs did you use? I can never find vegan ones (except for that one brand that are huge and chunky). Do you have to order them from one of the online vegan shoppes? March 28, 2011 at 8:15 pm: IsaChandra Whole Foods brand breadcrumbs are awesome. I\u2019ve found other vegan ones and I can\u2019t recall the brands, but you\u2019re right, it can be tough. You know what also works really well? If you can find vegan stuffing mix. It turns into magic in the food processor. I believe Pepperidge Farm makes one. March 28, 2011 at 7:46 pm: Sherene Can\u2019t wait to try this!!!!! Thanks so much for your creative culinary expertise!!! March 28, 2011 at 9:02 pm: Rebekah LOL @ catnip for vegans! Too true. March 28, 2011 at 9:44 pm: Melomeals: Vegan for $3.33 a Day I think i love you. March 28, 2011 at 9:45 pm: Bianca- Vegan Crunk Yep, that catnip for vegans line made me spew water all over my keyboard. That\u2019s so true! My cats also like nooch\u2026.so it may also be like catnip for cats. I\u2019m soooo making this btw. I lived on cold cans of Spaghetti-O\u2019s in college, March 28, 2011 at 11:21 pm: A.Cook You are brilliant! If I weren\u2019t too lazy to go pick up some ingredients right now, I\u2019d make it tonight. Also, laughed out loud at \u201ccatnip for vegans.\u201d So glad to know it\u2019s not just me! March 28, 2011 at 11:23 pm: Heidi This sounds so good. Funnily enough, I have tempeh on hand rather than lentils\u2013would you imagine I could sub using the same method? March 29, 2011 at 1:17 am: IsaChandra Hmmm. I would steam the tempeh first and then grate it. The moisture content will be different so you might have to add a bit more water to make everything hold together. Let me know how it goes! March 29, 2011 at 12:08 am: Jessie I just made the lentil meatballs (had everything on hand!) without a food processor and they were still dynamite! I should have simmered my lentils longer so they would fall apart more, but even with some chunky pieces they have great texture. I made my own sauce recipe, but added nooch while it was simmering to get a bit of cheesy flavor going on. So looking forward to assembling the whole dish for dinner! March 29, 2011 at 12:21 am: Mama Pea You did NOT. This is awesome. March 29, 2011 at 4:01 am: megs YOM. Very excited to try this soon! I\u2019ve got Mac \u2018n\u2019 Shews on the plan for tomorrow\u2026 March 29, 2011 at 4:19 am: Kris Anybody have any replacement suggestions for the vital wheat gluten? My wife is vegan and gluten intolorant March 29, 2011 at 5:08 am: IsaChandra I would try some extra GF breadcrumbs. It will be a little mushier but still good, I think. March 29, 2011 at 4:41 am: Kim yay. these look exciting. i also love the name! March 29, 2011 at 6:42 am: Daniel Instead of meatballs why not call them neatballs?

Download Get the latest version of Nivo Slider here Usage Basic instructions for Nivo Slider Support A little bit of help for anyone who needs it File: nivo-slider2.5.1.zip Size: 366kb Release Date: 23 Mar 2011 Requires: jQuery 1.4+ Tweet The Nivo Slider is 1 year old! Current Features (v2.5.1) 16 unique transition effects Simple clean & valid markup Loads of settings to tweak Built in directional and control navigation Packed version only weighs 15kb Supports linking images Keyboard Navigation HTML Captions Free to use and abuse under the MIT license Browser Support Nivo Slider has been tested in the following browsers: Internet Explorer v7+ Firefox v3+ Google Chrome v4+ Safari v4+ Opera v10+ Demos Have a look at the demos to get an idea of what can be done with the Nivo Slider. Home > Usage Usage To use the Nivo Slider you have to include the following in your page: jQuery Nivo Slider script Nivo Slider CSS You also need to add some body HTML. This is ususally just a <div> with images. Note that only images or images wrapped in links are allowed in the slider div. Any other HTML will break the slider. <!-- Usually in the <head> section --> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"nivo-slider.css\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\" /> <script src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script> <script src=\"jquery.nivo.slider.pack.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script> <!-- Then somewhere in the <body> section --> <div id=\"slider\"> <img src=\"images/slide1.jpg\" alt=\"\" /> <a href=\"http://dev7studios.com\"><img src=\"images/slide2.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"#htmlcaption\" /></a> <img src=\"images/slide3.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"This is an example of a caption\" /> <img src=\"images/slide4.jpg\" alt=\"\" /> </div> <div id=\"htmlcaption\" class=\"nivo-html-caption\"> <strong>This</strong> is an example of a <em>HTML</em> caption with <a href=\"#\">a link</a>. </div> To add a caption to an image you simply need to add a title attribute to the image. To add an HTML Caption simply set the title attribute to the ID of a element that contains your caption (prefixed with a hash). Note that the HTML element that contains your caption must have the CSS class nivo-html-caption applied and must be outside of the slider div. Then it helps to add some CSS to make the slider look good while it's loading: #slider { position:relative; width:618px; /* Change this to your images width */ height:246px; /* Change this to your images height */ background:url(images/loading.gif) no-repeat 50% 50%; } #slider img { position:absolute; top:0px; left:0px; display:none; } #slider a { border:0; display:block; } Finally you need to hook up your script using the $(window).load() function: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> $(window).load(function() { $('#slider').nivoSlider(); }); </script> The Nivo Slider has plenty of options to fiddle with. Below is an example of the code with all available options and their defaults: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> $(window).load(function() { $('#slider').nivoSlider({ effect:'random', // Specify sets like: 'fold,fade,sliceDown' slices:15, // For slice animations boxCols: 8, // For box animations boxRows: 4, // For box animations animSpeed:500, // Slide transition speed pauseTime:3000, // How long each slide will show startSlide:0, // Set starting Slide (0 index) directionNav:true, // Next & Prev navigation directionNavHide:true, // Only show on hover controlNav:true, // 1,2,3... navigation controlNavThumbs:false, // Use thumbnails for Control Nav controlNavThumbsFromRel:false, // Use image rel for thumbs controlNavThumbsSearch: '.jpg', // Replace this with... controlNavThumbsReplace: '_thumb.jpg', // ...this in thumb Image src keyboardNav:true, // Use left & right arrows pauseOnHover:true, // Stop animation while hovering manualAdvance:false, // Force manual transitions captionOpacity:0.8, // Universal caption opacity prevText: 'Prev', // Prev directionNav text nextText: 'Next', // Next directionNav text beforeChange: function(){}, // Triggers before a slide transition afterChange: function(){}, // Triggers after a slide transition slideshowEnd: function(){}, // Triggers after all slides have been shown lastSlide: function(){}, // Triggers when last slide is shown afterLoad: function(){} // Triggers when slider has loaded }); }); </script> The effect parameter can be any of the following: sliceDown sliceDownLeft sliceUp sliceUpLeft sliceUpDown sliceUpDownLeft fold fade random slideInRight slideInLeft boxRandom boxRain boxRainReverse boxRainGrow boxRainGrowReverse Advanced Usage For more advanced examples of how to use the Nivo Slider see these tutorials: Setting Up the Nivo Slider in WordPress Using Thumbnails with the Nivo Slider Skinning the Nivo Slider Other Platforms Try these plugins for WordPress: WP Nivo Slider Nivo Slider Light Easy Nivo Slider Download the Nivo Slider or Views Nivo Slider Drupal modules.

The bursting of the dot-com bubble in the fall of 2001 marked a turning point for the web. Many people concluded that the web was overhyped, when in fact bubbles and consequent shakeouts appear to be a common feature of all technological revolutions. Shakeouts typically mark the point at which an ascendant technology is ready to take its place at center stage. The pretenders are given the bum's rush, the real success stories show their strength, and there begins to be an understanding of what separates one from the other. The concept of \"Web 2.0\" began with a conference brainstorming session between O'Reilly and MediaLive International. Dale Dougherty, web pioneer and O'Reilly VP, noted that far from having \"crashed\", the web was more important than ever, with exciting new applications and sites popping up with surprising regularity. What's more, the companies that had survived the collapse seemed to have some things in common. Could it be that the dot-com collapse marked some kind of turning point for the web, such that a call to action such as \"Web 2.0\" might make sense? We agreed that it did, and so the Web 2.0 Conference was born. In the year and a half since, the term \"Web 2.0\" has clearly taken hold, with more than 9.5 million citations in Google. But there's still a huge amount of disagreement about just what Web 2.0 means, with some people decrying it as a meaningless marketing buzzword, and others accepting it as the new conventional wisdom. This article is an attempt to clarify just what we mean by Web 2.0. In our initial brainstorming, we formulated our sense of Web 2.0 by example: Web 1.0 \u00a0 Web 2.0 DoubleClick --> Google AdSense Ofoto --> Flickr Akamai --> BitTorrent mp3.com --> Napster Britannica Online --> Wikipedia personal websites --> blogging evite --> upcoming.org and EVDB domain name speculation --> search engine optimization page views --> cost per click screen scraping --> web services publishing --> participation content management systems --> wikis directories (taxonomy) --> tagging (\"folksonomy\") stickiness --> syndication The list went on and on. But what was it that made us identify one application or approach as \"Web 1.0\" and another as \"Web 2.0\"? (The question is particularly urgent because the Web 2.0 meme has become so widespread that companies are now pasting it on as a marketing buzzword, with no real understanding of just what it means. The question is particularly difficult because many of those buzzword-addicted startups are definitely not Web 2.0, while some of the applications we identified as Web 2.0, like Napster and BitTorrent, are not even properly web applications!) We began trying to tease out the principles that are demonstrated in one way or another by the success stories of web 1.0 and by the most interesting of the new applications. Learn more about Web 2.0 at: Web 2.0 Expo is a conference and tradeshow for everyone who cares about embracing and extending the opportunities created by Web 2.0 technologies Co-produced by O'Reilly Media and TechWeb Web 2.0 Summit is an exclusive annual event that connects the business leaders, big thinkers, and innovative technologists who are shaping the future of the Web. Co-produced by O'Reilly Media and TechWeb 1. The Web As Platform Like many important concepts, Web 2.0 doesn't have a hard boundary, but rather, a gravitational core. You can visualize Web 2.0 as a set of principles and practices that tie together a veritable solar system of sites that demonstrate some or all of those principles, at a varying distance from that core. Figure 1 shows a \"meme map\" of Web 2.0 that was developed at a brainstorming session during FOO Camp, a conference at O'Reilly Media. It's very much a work in progress, but shows the many ideas that radiate out from the Web 2.0 core. For example, at the first Web 2.0 conference, in October 2004, John Battelle and I listed a preliminary set of principles in our opening talk. The first of those principles was \"The web as platform.\" Yet that was also a rallying cry of Web 1.0 darling Netscape, which went down in flames after a heated battle with Microsoft. What's more, two of our initial Web 1.0 exemplars, DoubleClick and Akamai, were both pioneers in treating the web as a platform. People don't often think of it as \"web services\", but in fact, ad serving was the first widely deployed web service, and the first widely deployed \"mashup\" (to use another term that has gained currency of late). Every banner ad is served as a seamless cooperation between two websites, delivering an integrated page to a reader on yet another computer. Akamai also treats the network as the platform, and at a deeper level of the stack, building a transparent caching and content delivery network that eases bandwidth congestion. Nonetheless, these pioneers provided useful contrasts because later entrants have taken their solution to the same problem even further, understanding something deeper about the nature of the new platform. Both DoubleClick and Akamai were Web 2.0 pioneers, yet we can also see how it's possible to realize more of the possibilities by embracing additional Web 2.0 design patterns. Let's drill down for a moment into each of these three cases, teasing out some of the essential elements of difference. Netscape vs. Google If Netscape was the standard bearer for Web 1.0, Google is most certainly the standard bearer for Web 2.0, if only because their respective IPOs were defining events for each era. So let's start with a comparison of these two companies and their positioning. Netscape framed \"the web as platform\" in terms of the old software paradigm: their flagship product was the web browser, a desktop application, and their strategy was to use their dominance in the browser market to establish a market for high-priced server products. Control over standards for displaying content and applications in the browser would, in theory, give Netscape the kind of market power enjoyed by Microsoft in the PC market. Much like the \"horseless carriage\" framed the automobile as an extension of the familiar, Netscape promoted a \"webtop\" to replace the desktop, and planned to populate that webtop with information updates and applets pushed to the webtop by information providers who would purchase Netscape servers. In the end, both web browsers and web servers turned out to be commodities, and value moved \"up the stack\" to services delivered over the web platform. Google, by contrast, began its life as a native web application, never sold or packaged, but delivered as a service, with customers paying, directly or indirectly, for the use of that service. None of the trappings of the old software industry are present. No scheduled software releases, just continuous improvement. No licensing or sale, just usage. No porting to different platforms so that customers can run the software on their own equipment, just a massively scalable collection of commodity PCs running open source operating systems plus homegrown applications and utilities that no one outside the company ever gets to see. At bottom, Google requires a competency that Netscape never needed: database management. Google isn't just a collection of software tools, it's a specialized database. Without the data, the tools are useless; without the software, the data is unmanageable. Software licensing and control over APIs--the lever of power in the previous era--is irrelevant because the software never need be distributed but only performed, and also because without the ability to collect and manage the data, the software is of little use. In fact, the value of the software is proportional to the scale and dynamism of the data it helps to manage. Google's service is not a server--though it is delivered by a massive collection of internet servers--nor a browser--though it is experienced by the user within the browser. Nor does its flagship search service even host the content that it enables users to find. Much like a phone call, which happens not just on the phones at either end of the call, but on the network in between, Google happens in the space between browser and search engine and destination content server, as an enabler or middleman between the user and his or her online experience. While both Netscape and Google could be described as software companies, it's clear that Netscape belonged to the same software world as Lotus, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, and other companies that got their start in the 1980's software revolution, while Google's fellows are other internet applications like eBay, Amazon, Napster, and yes, DoubleClick and Akamai.

For more information click here. 4601 reads Printer-friendly version Published Mar 14 2010 by Low-tech Magazine, Archived Mar 15 2010 How to make your own low-tech vertical farm by Kris De Decker The ingenious low-cost vertical farms of Willem Van Cotthem are within reach of everybody. Vertical farming has become a popular idea, but what is mostly forgotten is that the energy required for the operation and construction of vertical farms largely negates the ecological advantages. This also applies to small-scale systems, like those of Philips (a concept) or Inka Biospheric Solutions (a product). A while ago two New York ladies made headlines with their \"Window farms\", described as a kind of low-tech indoor vertical farming system (illustration on the right). Upon a closer look, however, I found the method to be rather high-tech and cumbersome, in spite of the use of plastic bottles. A window farm is based on hydroponics, it makes use of lamps, pumps and electricity, it still requires you to buy quite a lot of new stuff, and the whole thing would surely come crashing down if I were to install it. The Belgian professor Willem Van Cotthem seems to have designed a do-it-yourself vertical kitchen garden system that truly deserves the low-tech label. On his blog, \"Container Gardening\", he explains how to transform normal plastic bottles into efficient containers (and a container rack) for growing all kinds of plants, even young trees (to be transplanted when reaching sufficient height). The beauty is that the water supply can be automated without the use of electricity, and that his way of installing a vertical garden looks much simpler and sturdier. Willem Van Cotthem is a researcher specializing in combating desertification, an occupation he describes on his other blog, \"Desertification\". Here lies the origin of his low-cost, low-tech methods to grow plants and crops. Van Cotthem manages to grow vegetables and fruits in the middle of the desert with minimal water (pictures). Apart from the methods using plastic bottles described above, he also uses\u00a0mini-greenhouses made of trash (yoghurt pots, plastic bags) to produce vegetable and (fruit) tree seedlings. All systems can be used both indoors and outdoors. What all these methods have in common, is that they hardly use any water, basically by minimizing evaporation. Moreover, because of the low cost (using 100 percent trash), the systems can be used even by the poorest of people. Plastic rubbish is, unfortunately, everywhere. Van Cotthem's blogs can be a bit chaotic to navigate, but his work is definitely worth a look. \u00a9 Kris De Decker (edited by Matt Hill). Thanks to Theo Lalleman for the tip.

IE-CSS3 is a script to provide Internet Explorer support for some new styles available in the upcoming CSS3 standard. How it works If you're viewing this page in Internet Explorer, some of the elements have been rebuilt by the script in Vector Markup Language (VML), an IE-specific vector drawing language. VML supports things that are missing from IE's CSS implementation like rounded corners and blur effects. How to use it Just add CSS styles as you normally would, but include one new line: .box { -moz-border-radius: 15px; /* Firefox */ -webkit-border-radius: 15px; /* Safari and Chrome */ border-radius: 15px; /* Opera 10.5+, future browsers, and now also Internet Explorer 6+ using IE-CSS3 */ -moz-box-shadow: 10px 10px 20px #000; /* Firefox */ -webkit-box-shadow: 10px 10px 20px #000; /* Safari and Chrome */ box-shadow: 10px 10px 20px #000; /* Opera 10.5+, future browsers and IE6+ using IE-CSS3 */ behavior: url(ie-css3.htc); /* This lets IE know to call the script on all elements which get the 'box' class */ } Issues and Workarounds You would expect URLs in behavior: url(...) to be relative to the current directory as they are in a background-image: url(...) style for example, but instead Microsoft decided to ignore standards here and make them relative to the docroot instead. So behavior: url(ie-css3.htc) should work if ie-css3.htc is in the root directory of the site. You will probably run into issues with z-index, especially if embedding one IE-CSS3 enabled element inside of another. There are two simple workarounds: Set the z-index of the IE-CSS3 element to a number larger than its surrounding elements. Make sure the IE-CSS3 element is positioned, such as with position: relative or position: absolute Sometimes an IE-CSS3 element will show up at a slightly different position than the original, untouched element. There could be a few reasons for this: You have broken tags somewhere in your markup, probably above the IE-CSS3 element. You are experiencing misc IE6 and IE7 bugs. Try adding the styles zoom: 1 and/or position: relative to the IE-CSS3 element and its immediate parent. You could also try removing any margins on the IE-CSS3 element and/or its parent, use padding instead. Styles and their status Style What works What doesn't work border-radius Setting a radius for all four corners Element borders Setting a radius for individual corners separately box-shadow Blur size Offset Any color other than #000 text-shadow Blur size Offset Color The shadow looks a little bit different than it does in FF/Safari/Chrome, I'm not sure why TODO A better site for this script :) This cat does not approve of square corners. Thanks to Remiz Rahnas for writing the original script that this is based off of. Download If you like this script or have any suggestions/bug reports, let me know. "}

Many of my future videos will address the last 30 seconds of this video (the \"rethink ...\" part).Thank you all for the helpful comments on the earlier draft.

I received many more positive comments than negative about the song choice (great work Deus!), but if you are one of those who does not like the song just download the video and change the audio track to your liking.The video was created by me (Michael Wesch), working alone from my house in St. George, Kansas. I used CamStudio for the screen captures and Sony Vegas for the panning/cropping/zooming animations. Someday I might make a video tutorial for those who are interested.

My job is also hard: how does one balance both functionality and usability in programming interfaces? I've been working, with Ralph Schindler, on a set of proposals around the Zend Framework 2.0 MVC layer, specifically the \"C\", or \"Controller\" portion of the triad. There are a ton of requirements we're trying to juggle, from making the code approachable to newcomers all the way to making the code as extensible as possible for the radical performance tuning developers out there. One interface I've been toying with is inspired by two very different sources. The first is PHP's own SoapServer API (which we use already in our various server components); the other was a discussion I had with Fabien Potencier (of Symfony fame) a couple years ago, where he said the goal of Symfony 2 would be \"to transform a request into a response.\" What I've come up with right now is the following: interface Dispatchable{\u00a0 \u00a0 /**\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* @return Response\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0*/\u00a0 \u00a0 public function dispatch(Request $request);}\u00a0 I can hear some of you ZF folks saying already, \"Really, that's all you've come up with so far?\" Here's why I think it may be remarkable: It makes it trivially simple to do a ZF1 style MVC, incorporate server endpoints as controllers, or to write your own micro MVC. The idea is that this interface (and the Request/Response interfaces) become the basic building blocks for both a standard ZF MVC implementation, or your own custom MVC implementation. Which is where the subject of micro MVCs finally becomes relevant. Micro MVCs A little over a year ago, with PHP 5.3 finally releasing, I started seeing a number of \"micro MVC frameworks\" popping up; seriously, for a while there, it seemed like every other day, phpdeveloper was posting a new one every other day. Micro MVCs are quite interesting. If you consider the bulk of the websites you encounter, they really only consist of a few pages, and a smattering of actual functionality that requires things like form handling or models. As such, using a full-blown MVC such as ZF, Symfony, even CodeIgniter, seems crazy. A micro MVC addresses simultaneously the issues of simplification and expressiveness; the point is to get the work done as quickly as possible, preferably with as few lines as possible. In looking at many of these micro MVC frameworks, I noted a few things: Most were either using regex for routing, or a lightweight router such as Horde Routes to route the request. Most were utilizing closures and/or currying to then map the routing results to \"actions\". So I whipped up a little something using the above Dispatchable interface, to see what I might be able to do. use Zend\\Stdlib\\Dispatchable,\u00a0 \u00a0 Zend\\Http\\Response as HttpResponse,\u00a0 \u00a0 Fig\\Request,\u00a0 \u00a0 Fig\\Response;class Dispatcher implements Dispatchable{\u00a0 \u00a0 protected $controllers;\u00a0 \u00a0 public function attach($spec, $callback = null)\u00a0 \u00a0 {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 if (is_array($spec) || $spec instanceof \\Traversable) {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 foreach ($spec as $controller => $callback) {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 $this->attach($controller, $callback);\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 }\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 return $this;\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 }\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 if (!is_scalar($spec)) {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 throw new \\InvalidArgumentException('Spec must be scalar or traversable');\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 }\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 if (!is_callable($callback)) {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 throw new \\InvalidArgumentException('Callback must be callable');\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 }\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 $this->controllers[$spec] = $callback;\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 return $this;\u00a0 \u00a0 }\u00a0 \u00a0 /**\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* Dispatch a request\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* @param\u00a0 Request $request \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0* @return Response\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0*/\u00a0 \u00a0 public function dispatch(Request $request)\u00a0 \u00a0 {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 if (!$controller = $request->getMetadata('controller')) {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 return new PageNotFoundResponse( '<h1>Page not found</h1>' );\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 }\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 if (!array_key_exists($controller, $this->controllers)) {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 return new PageNotFoundResponse('<h1>Page not found</h1>');\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 }\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 $handler\u00a0 = $this->controllers[$controller];\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 $response = $handler($request);\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 if (is_string($response)) {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 return new HttpResponse($response);\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 }\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 if (!is_object($response)) {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 return new ApplicationErrorResponse('<h1>An error occurred</h1>');\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 }\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 if (!$response instanceof Response) {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 if (!method_exists($response, '__toString')) {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 return new ApplicationErrorResponse('<h1>An error occurred</h1>');\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 }\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 return new HttpResponse($response->__toString());\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 }\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 return $response;\u00a0 \u00a0 }}\u00a0 Don't worry about the various objects referenced; the main thing to understand is that it's using those same building blocks I referred to earlier: Request, Response, Dispatchable.

The Dispatcher checks to see if the Router found a controller name in the Request, and, if it did and a callback for it exists, executes it. If it gets a string, we use that as the content; an exception triggers an ApplicationErrorResponse, and if we get a Response object back, we just use it. While I did the Dispatcher configuration/setup in the same script, it could have been done as an include file to simplify that script endpoint. The point is that the interface definitions made this really, really easy to come up with and implement in a matter of minutes. I'm not sure if this will end up being in ZF2; even if it isn't, it still meets the goal I set out at the start of this post: balancing usability with flexibility. Discuss! Updates 2011-02-24: Fixed first class declaration example to use \"implements\" instead of \"extends\" Posted by Matthew Weier O'Phinney in PHP at 18:07 | Comments (10) | Trackbacks (0) Defined tags for this entry: mvc, php, zend frameworkRelated entries by tags: Code Generation with Zend\\CodeGenerator Dependency Injection: An analogy The Ideas of March Git Subtree Merging Guide PHP Community Conference Trackbacks Trackback specific URI for this entry No Trackbacks Comments Display comments as (Linear | Threaded) In looking at micro mvcs, one that I always really admired (and even copied onto google code) was the python web.py library. The way that it separates out GET/POST et al is really nice, and for most sites it really is all the functionality you need. Seeing how the REST part is added on, I would settle for a REST implementation baked in, the idea of using closures is just awesome, so maybe (and this is a few beers into the evening btw) it could just be as simple as assigning closure to public vars $c = new Controller; $c->get = function(){...} $c->post = function(){...} etc. #1 Kenrick on 2010-12-22 19:49 (Reply) ah and then if you just wanted say get to echo a string, or load a template, $c->get = file_get_contents(); or whatever the dispatcher can easily determine if the ->get is a string, array, closure etc and base its response on that. Does some framework already do this? #2 Kenrick on 2010-12-22 20:01 (Reply) For a \"micro framework\" style interface to be really useful I think it's needed to offer a bit more than mapping routes to \"callbacks\". The currying (fluent) interface allows to define more stuff in a quite compact way for small projects, like filters, custom error handlers, arguments validation, etc. $app->bind('/*') ->before('my_sql_injection_filter') ->catch('my_error_handler'); $app->bind('/:username/:foo') ->constraint('username', 'is_numeric') ->constraint('foo', '/[a-z]+/') ->do(function($r){ echo \"Username is $r->username\" }); I've also found useful to allow creating sub-routes, which come in very handy when the application starts to grow. $app->bind('/entry/*') ->route(function(&$sub){ // This can also be an include file $sub->bind(':id') ->do('var_dump'); }); #3 DrSlump (Link) on 2010-12-22 20:28 (Reply) This was simply a proof-of-concept, and not intended to be something production-ready, or even usable. #3.1 Matthew Weier O'Phinney (Link) on 2010-12-28 09:43 (Reply) I think it's a good aproach. But I would slightly modify it - instead (or additionaly) to closures it would be nice to have an object implementing an RequestHandler interface (for example with a method named handle($request)) that would also implement the intercepting filter pattern. This way one could build some response to a request using standartized building blocks. The request once passed to the first element of the chain of RequestHandlers would be processed throught it and finaly returning a response. The RequestHandlers could be chained programmaticaly as well as with help of some config files. #4 sokzzuka (Link) on 2010-12-23 03:16 (Reply) I've actually created two other proof-of-concepts using these building blocks that did exactly that (basically, a filter chain, that exited as soon as a filter returned a response). Again, this was just to show how having clean, simply interfaces can facilitate a variety of compatible approaches to the same problem. #4.1 Matthew Weier O'Phinney (Link) on 2010-12-28 09:45 (Reply) Notice also, that the whole controller part of an application could be done in this fashion. The dispatcher could be written as a filter element and attached as as first part of the chain. The same could be done with cacheing frontend, logging etc... #4.1.1 sokzzuka (Link) on 2010-12-29 05:40 (Reply) Thats very close to what I use. Different name but the same intention and similar implementation. #5 Montreal Web Design (Link) on 2011-01-05 01:36 (Reply) Hi Mathew, There is a typo in the first snippet. You use \"extends\" instead of \"implements\".

Part of the initialization of Microsoft Office, values are pulled out of the registry in order for the application to execute as the user would expect the program to run.\u00a0 When the CDCache is set to a value other than 0, Windows tries to perform a supplemental install that http://www.sku011cab.com deems to be unnecessary.\u00a0 Updating the CDCache value in the registry to 0, fixes the issue pertaining to sku011.cab.\u00a0 In short, no additional file needs to be downloaded and the next section gives a step by step instruction to update your Microsoft Office CDCache value to 0.\u00a0\u00a0 sku011.cab step by step instructions Below are 7 easy steps that need to be taken in order to fix your error related sku011.cab.\u00a0 These steps do involve updating the registry which can be hazardous because the Windows Operating System along with the Applications that run on windows relay on the values set in the registry.\u00a0 This is why it is very import to be sure you are updating the right values.\u00a0 The below instructions contain images to help avoid any confusion and provide a higher level of confidence that you are in fact updating the correct values.\u00a0 Please follow the instructions below at your own risk.1. Click on your Start menu and select \u201cRun\u2026\u201d \u00a0figure 2.\u00a02. Once the dialogue box appears, type in 'regedit' and click \u201cOK\u201d\u00a0figure 3.3. In the left tree structure, navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -> Software->Microsoft -> Office -> 11.0 -> Delivery.\u00a0 \u00a0figure 4.4. There should be one entry under Delivery folder (e.g. {91E30409-6000-11D3-8CFE-0150048383C9} ), select that directory.figure 5.5. On the right side of the window, right-click on CDCache and select the first menu item \u2018Modify\u2019.\u00a0figure 6.\u00a06. An \u2018Edit String\u2019 dialogue box will appear on your screen. Make sure to note the current value in this box incase you want to revert the changes that you have made. Change the value in the \u2018Value Data:\u2019 field to 0 and click \u2018OK\u2019.\u00a0 Once this is done, your registry will have been updated.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0figure 7.7. This completes the necessary changes that need to be made in order to fix the error message that appears in figure 1.\u00a0 Now that you are done, close all the windows that you opened and restart your favorite Microsoft Office product.\u00a0 If you have any additional questions please post them below, which will be reviewed by the http://www.sku011cab.com community.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Comments Add New Search George \u00a0 |74.208.65.xxx |2009-01-29 10:42:25 Thanks for helping me fix my sku011.cab error!!!!!!

Seeing as Microsoft Office is currently not working for you, it would bea good bet to change both to fix the sku011.cab error.

You're probably familiar with the popular proprietary commercial package Norton Ghost\u00ae. The problem with these kind of software packages is that it takes a lot of time to massively clone systems to many computers. You've probably also heard of Symantec's solution to this problem, Symantec Ghost Corporate Edition\u00ae with multicasting. Well, now there is an OpenSource clone system (OCS) solution called Clonezilla with unicasting and multicasting! Clonezilla, based on DRBL, Partclone and udpcast, allows you to do bare metal backup and recovery. Two types of Clonezilla are available, Clonezilla live and Clonezilla SE (server edition). Clonezilla live is suitable for single machine backup and restore. While Clonezilla SE is for massive deployment, it can clone many (40 plus!) computers simultaneously. Clonezilla saves and restores only used blocks in the harddisk. This increases the clone efficiency. At the NCHC's Classroom C, Clonezilla SE was used to clone 41 computers simultaneously. It took only about 10 minutes to clone a 5.6 GBytes system image to all 41 computers via multicasting! Features: Free (GPL) Software. Filesystem supported: (1) ext2, ext3, ext4, reiserfs, reiser4, xfs, jfs of GNU/Linux, (2) FAT, NTFS of MS Windows, (3) HFS+ of Mac OS, (4) UFS of FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD, and (5) VMFS of VMWare ESX. Therefore you can clone GNU/Linux, MS windows, Intel-based Mac OS, and FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD, no matter it's 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x86-64) OS. For these file systems, only used blocks in partition are saved and restored. For unsupported file system, sector-to-sector copy is done by dd in Clonezilla. LVM2 (LVM version 1 is not) under GNU/Linux is supported. Grub (version 1 and version 2) is supported. Unattended mode is supported. Almost all steps can be done via commands and options. You can also use a lot of boot parameters to customize your own imaging and cloning. Multicast is supported in Clonezilla SE, which is suitable for massively clone. You can also remotely use it to save or restore a bunch of computers if PXE and Wake-on-LAN are supported in your clients. The image file can be on local disk, ssh server, samba server, or NFS server. Based on Partclone (default), Partimage (optional), ntfsclone (optional), or dd to image or clone a partition. However, Clonezilla, containing some other programs, can save and restore not only partitions, but also a whole disk. By using another free software drbl-winroll, which is also developed by us, the hostname, group, and SID of cloned MS windows machine can be automatically changed. Minimum System Requirements for Clonezilla live: X86 or x86-64 processor 196 MB of system memory (RAM) Boot device, e.g. CD/DVD Drive, USB port, PXE, or hard drive Limitations: The destination partition must be equal or larger than the source one. Differential/incremental backup is not implemented yet. Online imaging/cloning is not implemented yet. The partition to be imaged or cloned has to be unmounted. Software RAID/fake RAID is not supported by default. It's can be done manually only. Due to the image format limitation, the image can not be explored or mounted. You can _NOT_ recovery single file from the image. However, you still have workaround to make it, read this. Recovery Clonezilla live with multiple CDs or DVDs is not implemented yet. Now all the files have to be in one CD or DVD if you choose to create the recovery iso file. License: Clonezilla itself is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2. However, to run Clonezilla, a lot of free and open source software, e.g. the Linux kernel, a mininal GNU/Linux OS, are required. Which Clonezilla Shall I Use ? Clonezilla Live: Clonezilla live allows you to use CD/DVD or USB flash drive to boot and run clonezilla (Unicast only) Clonezilla SE: Clonezilla SE is included in DRBL, therefore a DRBL server must first be set up in order to use Clonezilla to do massively clone (unicast, broadcast and multicast are supported) Modified: Fri Feb 25 17:57:53 MST 2011.

At least not when \"traditional media\" means TV. According to the latest research from eMarketer, advertisers are spending more than ever on the broadcast networks and cable, around $60.5 billion on commercial time this year, making TV the richest media segment, with 39.1% of all ad spending, up from 38.6% in 2010. The research firm attributes the share growth to the \"recovering economy,\" but also found the industry is expanding at the expense of other media, specifically newspapers and magazines, and to some degree the internet. The durability and growth of TV has to come as a surprise to many who predicted that TV dollars would shift to the web along with the growing amount of time consumers spend entertaining themselves on Facebook, Hulu and YouTube. \"Even though online advertising has been robust, it hasn't stopped advertisers from keeping the bulk of their budgets right on TV,\" eMarketer CEO Geoff Ramsey said, pointing out that even in spite of consumers' healthy appetite for content on laptops and cellphones, it's not having any discernible effect on their TV habits, or on the amount of money marketers are looking to spend to get in front of their faces. EMarketer estimates that $64.5 billion will be spent on TV advertising next year, almost double the amount marketers will spend on the internet. \"TV remains supreme because it's still seen as a mass-reach vehicle that drives awareness,\" Mr. Ramsay said. But in an age of simultaneous media usage where one media often drives another and back again, it will become harder to justify discrete budgets. Simultaneous media consumption has become a regular habit among Americans, according to Nielsen Co. Since 2009, around 60% of the TV audience has been regularly clicking through the internet while watching their favorite shows, a fact that is more astounding when considering we're watching more TV than ever, averaging about 35 hours per week in early 2010, vs. 33 hours a week in 2009. But we're not distracting ourselves into oblivion. It turns out that people aren't watching Fox's \"Glee\" while checking e-mail, but they are more likely commenting on the latest episode on Twitter and Facebook while scrolling through websites such as IMDB to check a particular actor's resume or scan synopses of previous episodes. \"The internet is fueling the TV content,\" Mr. Ramsay said, noting how the two media have become much more blurred. And as more people adopt the practice of watching internet content on their TV screens, whether via specialized set-top boxes or even a jerry-rigged set up, it will become harder to discern where TV begins and the internet ends, Mr. Ramsay said. \"We're already staring to see the semblance of this now,\" he said, \"but TV will remain dominant for some time.\" Tweet [+]\u00a0Share Share & Save | Email| Buy Reprints| Print| Comment| RSS RSS feed of comments Comments Most ReadLet's Pray for the Safe Release of the BoingBoing BloggersCoors Light Cold Train Hurtling Toward BudBMW Launches Comprehensive Review for U.S. BusinessWill Ads in Real Time Be Facebook's Holy Grail?Discover Strikes Social-Media Gold With 'Peggy'Most CommentedLet's Pray for the Safe Release of the BoingBoing BloggersAflac Goes on Duck Hunt to Find New Spokes-QuackerWill Ads in Real Time Be Facebook's Holy Grail?Discover Strikes Social-Media Gold With 'Peggy'Coors Light Cold Train Hurtling Toward BudMost EmailedARF Panel Finds Promise for Neuromarketing, but Also Plenty of ProblemsCoors Light Cold Train Hurtling Toward BudOf Course Social Media Works -- If You Measure It RightMarketers Aren't Sure About ROI but Will Spend More on Social Media, WFA SaysAmong Media, TV Is Still on Top An Ad Age Insights/Creativity Trend Report New series on the best creative work of 2011 And how agencies are structuring to deliver integrated campaigns, apps, viral video and more.

{"url":"http://www.soundbarspeakers.org/","title":"Soundbar Speakers","tags":["speakers","soundbar-speakers"],"body":" Sound Bar Speakers Home PageYou are here: Home 3 Answers You Must Know Before You Buy A Soundbar Speaker System We all want to get a space saver soundbar speaker system, however, we can not just go out and get one just because we want to. We need to take some careful planning, and ask ourselves 3 simple questions. Do you know how many audio connectors you need? If you have multiple audio devices you want to make sure you can hook them all up at once, otherwise you might not be able to use all of them, and will be switched between devices on a constant basis. Sometimes if can be patched through the TV, but it will still only have a few select hook-ups and you still might fall short. Do you know how many video through puts you need? This goes mainly for HDMI through puts, if you don\u2019t have any, you won\u2019t be able to watch HD movies with the complete surround sound capabilities that you want. So if you have multiple HDMI devices and you want to content them all to this system, make sure it has enough. This could include such things as: PS3 XBOX 360 Nintendo Wii DVD/BLUE RAY Players Make sure you will be able to handle all the devices that you want, to make for a better over all experience. Falling short, might just ruin the whole experience for you, and make you regret your purchase. It is more of a hassle to have to return something, than it is to get it right the first time around. Will You be getting a sub woofer add on for your system? IF the system doesn\u2019t come with it\u2019s own sub woofer, and a lot of them don\u2019t, make sure that it does have a hook up for one. This will improve your bass experience, and make for a better viewing of movies, tv shows, and video games. Nothing says it better than hearing those explosions in full bass mode. As you can see, when going to buy a Soundbar Speaker System, you need to make sure you have the proper audio, and video connectors, as well as an ability to add on a sub woofer in the future if it lacks one in the whole package. Follow these guidelines, and you will have a totally different experience. Soundbar Speaker Review \u2013 4 Systems Compared Side By Side You Make The Choice I know it can be a little bit troubling not being able to find a good soundbar speaker review, especially with 4 systems shown side by side. Here I am going to show you the Philips HTS8100, Marantz ES7001, Yamaha YSP-3000, and Denon DHT-FS3, and their main features that seem to stand out. After you read this, you will have a better understanding of these 4 different systems, and be that much closer to buying your own. Philips HTS8100 This unit is an all in one home theater, you do not need a 3rd party A/V receiver, as it has all the hook ups. We all still listen to the radio from time to time, and this unit makes it that much easier as it supports AM/FM jacks to hook up an antenna too. This unit comes with 2 stereo analog inputs, and 1 conaxial plug for sound output. This is one of the few soundbar\u2019s that actually contains a DVD player which is vertically aligned, and has both HDMI, component, and composite video outputs. Amazingly enough it comes with a USB port, for a possible external HDD and an IPOD dock connector. Marantz ES7001 This Unit has 3 optical audio, 2 analog audio plugs 2 HDMI 1.1 inputs, meaning that it won\u2019t carry the higher bandwidth of 1.3, as well as a single HDMI output. The draw back is if you are using HDMI it must be both for audio and video, you can not use the optical audio connectors for your digital sound. This unit does have a pretty tight spot for the cabling, if you get this one you need to use thinner cables. Thinner cables mean less shielding, which in turn means increased chance of noise in the signal. Yamaha YSP-3000 If you don\u2019t mind the looks, it has more of a receiver feel to it than a speaker, which can have it\u2019s upsides if you are looking to hide this unit in plain sight. There are only 2 hdmi inputs on this one, so make sure you pick and choose what you want to have go through this for video/audio There are however 4 digital audio inputs which gives a wide variety to how many sound devices you want hooked up to this speaker. It doesn\u2019t come with it\u2019s own sub woofer, but it does have the pin outs for an optional sub, which means you can add one on later down the road. Denon DHT-FS3 This is a totally proprietary unit as it comes with both soundbar and sub woofer, and can not accept any outside influences. On the upside, it does mean it is a complete package, and shouldn\u2019t need anything else. The remote control is lacking in the backlighting department, so you might have a hard time using it in the dark, unless of course you have your own universal remote, then it just becomes an addition to the collection. If you want to pass your DVD player, or any other kind of video through this unit, think again, this set seriously lacks a video pass through, and can become quite a big flaw when you want to have your high octane movies blasting through. As you can see by this soundbar speaker review, that all of these systems have there own ups and downs, but you are just that much closer to deciding which one to take home. So which will it be? The Philips HTS8100? Marantz ES7001? Yamaha YSP-3000? Or the Denon DHT-FS3? The choice is yours. Soundbar Speaker \u2013 Learn 3 Benefits To Owning Your Own If you want to buy a soundbar speaker, then you need to know why you should have them in the first place. There are a number of reasons why you want to own a set, mostly it has to do with wiring, versatility, and over all size. With these 3 benefits you will find some good reasons why you should own your own set today. First off, these speakers are usually thin and rectangular in shape, and usually come as a singular unit, sometimes you can add a subwoofer for increased performance, but it is unnecessary because they already have a good bass performance. Since they are so small they can be put anywhere in your living room, and even be hidden so they don\u2019t clash with anything you might have around. A great solution for someone not in the mood to be running wiring all over the place. Since there are usually only 1 speaker with the setup, there is far less wiring that you have to worry about hiding. You won\u2019t be tripping over a ton of wiring, or allowing your living room to look like the inside of a disaster zone. With the amount of small digital amplifiers along with a grouping of tiny speakers, it is allowed to simulate actual surround sound in such a tiny package. Small and compact, but still produce 5.1 quality sound. If you find a good brand, they may even out perform actual 5.1 surround sound speakers since they have small tiny speakers through out them that gives the effect of surround sound, but you will never even know you didn\u2019t have it. The only real down fall is they are not actually surround sound, they are simulated, and this can sometimes drive up the cost, then again, this all depends on the brands you get. As you can see, getting your own soundbar speaker can potentially enhance your movie watching experience, you will not have to worry about placement, as they can be just about anywhere, not a lot of wiring to worry about because of the lack of speakers, and because of the technology behind the tiny speakers you still feel like you are right inside the movie, along with your favorite actors. Altec Lansing Soundbar \u2013 3 Soundbars from Altec Lansing You Should Be Aware Of When looking for an Altec Lansing soundbar, there are 3 to considering very closely. 2 are for your living room, and 1 very compact one is for your computer entertainment. Each has some different features that you might want to know about, but all in all the 2 living room speakers are quite similar, however, one of them does seem to have an advantage over the other, and you just might be pleasantly surprised at what that advantage might be. To learn more, just read and find out. Altec Lansing PT7031: A standard soundbar speaker system, looks good, and sounds good as well. You can not go wrong with this choice. replaces A/V receiver Tv, Dvd, Cable/Satellite plug on the rear panel 3 Digital inputs Video output is only for OSD Has sub output for added bass function Comes with universal remote control. Computer Soundbar Speaker: This one is totally designed to be used with a computer, and it will replace your current system without a problem, and far less cables too. And even though it only has 3 speakers inside the bar, it still gives off some pretty good surround sound over all. 2 small speakers in 1 angled speakers to widen audio depth can go right under your LCD monitor without a problem it has volume and mute buttons right on the speaker can replace all your current speakers, thus clearing up clutter on your desk connects other devices as well, such as IPOD\u2019s (classic, current, and shuffle), most MP3 players, and even laptops. The Cable does come included with this speaker. Altec Lansing PT8051: This one has a little kicker to it; it has a rear wireless speaker set up. So this gives you an extra speaker, for some higher quality sound, but still leaves the wires out of the picture. This would be a great way to give a little more power to your rear sound, by placing them right under the sofa or chairs, thus giving a true feeling of being inside the movies. 3 optical inputs 3 analog inputs comes with a wireless rear speaker that runs on a 2.4GHZ frequency Comes with wall mounting brakets replaces A/V receiver Comes with a Universal remove control As you can see these 3 Altec Lansing soundbar speaker are quite something else. You can have the standard set up, still not having to worry about wires. And even your computer can enjoy some good quality soundbar sound. Totally replacing your current computer setup, and getting rid of some of your desk top clutter. And then, you\u2019ve got one with a little more kick, it has an extra wireless speaker attached, which gives more freedom of sound placement, and still keeps the wires out of the way. So the choice is yours, you need to decide which one fits into your current set up, and you will get the most use out of. Soundbar Speakers \u2013 A Smart Buyers Checklist So you want to purchase soundbar speakers? Then don\u2019t go about it blindly, follow this simple and easy to follow check list to prepare yourself for this major purchase. You will learn how to prepare your home for these speakers, and what you must do before you even decide which one to get. Don\u2019t jump the gun here, if you do not properly prepare for this purchase, you may find yourself without a complete set up, and not knowing where to go from there. First thing you need to do is this: Check all the devices that you want to hook up to the speakers check all connections, and write them down. HDMI Composite (RCA) Coaxial Digital audio If you want to connect any device to these speakers you have to make sure it has all the available connections, especially if you want to be able to use them all once you get it all set up. Get the dimensions of your room This is done so you can gauge which would be the better speakers to get for your room size. See if your TV has a mount of it for these types of speakers Some speakerbars can be mounted directly onto an LCD TV, however, these are smaller ones, and do not have a lot in the way of hook ups, except to go to your TV. Clear away anything that is in front of your TV, as this is the most likely place you will put your sound bar. This will make it easy to set up right when you get home. If you are going to be placing it someone else, then make sure you clear that spot as well. It might be wise to actually pick a few different spots to try out, and see which one gives you the best sound. It all depends on the size and shape of your room. Label all cables at both ends What this will allow you to do is make sure you have everything hooked up to the right device, and there will be no confusion. I\u2019ve seen it happen where there is a mess of wires, and people are just plugging them in where ever, hoping they get it right. More often than not, they have to undo everything, sort out all the wires and slowly hook them up one at a time. Labeling them will allow for a speedy hook up, so you can get to enjoying your experience as soon as possible. Following this simple checklist will make your soundbar speakers buying experience more enjoyable, and less costly. There is nothing worse than having to go back for a different set up because you forgot to check all the inputs and outputs, or got the wrong size of speaker for your room. If you get it right the first time around, you will be sitting on you couch, with a cold drink in hand, and watching the latest and greatest in HD movies, with the sound cranked, and no care in the world.

I met him when I discovered his wonderful site, Make Beliefs Comix. He had designed it to help ESL students, but it turned out to be a great vocabulary resource for all K-12 students. His other site, Bill'z Treasure Chest, lets visitors of all ages explore different treasures in life. Zimmerman's book, Your Life in Comics: 100 Things for Guys to Write and Draw was released by Free Spirit Publishing last fall. It is the most recent of a series of books designed to encourage children to think and draw and write, especially young men. It's one part journal and one part sketchbook, with fun facts and school-appropriate websites included for additional reading. Each page presents an engaging prompt or prompts inviting response, sometimes in words, sometimes in drawings, always with critical thinking. Here are some examples: Design a new kind of locker and decorate it. 'The day everything went wrong ...' and 'The day everything went right ...' You've created a new extreme sport. What's it called? How do you do it? How do you win? As hard as we are all working to keep all children \u2014 and young men in particular \u2014 interested in developing literacy skills, let's not overlook a potential resource. Your Life in Comics is Zimmerman's 19th book, and I certainly hope it's not his last. (Full disclosure: Bill and I have exchanged email for a few years now, and he sent me copies of his books to review. Aside from that, no financial consideration is involved here. I respect what he has done, and I think teachers everywhere should know about it.)

One of them will probably show you how to query non-generic collections. Before it becomes available, let me show you an overview of what it presents. When you read and hear about LINQ, you almost always see queries that work on the generic collections provided by the .NET Framework. In fact, you can use LINQ to Objects with any type that implements IEnumerable<T>. This means that LINQ to Objects will work with your own generic collection types or generic collections from other frameworks.A problem you may encounter is that not all .NET collections actually implement IEnumerable<T>. In fact, only strongly-typed collections implement this interface. Arrays, generic lists and dictionaries are strongly-typed: you can work with an array of integers, a list of strings or a dictionary of Book objects. The non-generic collections do not implement IEnumerable<T>, but implement IEnumerable. Does this mean that you won\u2019t be able to use LINQ with ArrayList or DataSet objects, for example? Fortunately, solutions exist. In the following code sample, we use Cast<Book> to convert a non-generic ArrayList collection into a typed-collection of Book objects. This allows us to use the Where or Select operators for example: ArrayList arrayList = new ArrayList();arrayList.Add(new Book { Title=\"LINQ in Action\" });arrayList.Add(new Book { Title=\"LINQ for Fun\" });arrayList.Add(new Book { Title=\"Extreme LINQ\" });var titles =\u00a0 from book in arrayList.Cast<Book>()\u00a0 where book.Title.Contains(\"Action\")\u00a0 select book.Title; The Cast operator casts the elements of a source sequence to a given type.It\u2019s interesting to note that you can also use a feature of C# query expressions. In a C# query expression, an explicitly-typed iteration variable translates to an invocation of Cast. Here how to use Cast transparently by declaring the book iteration variable as a Book: var titles =\u00a0 from Book book in arrayList \u00a0 where book.Title.Contains(\"Action\") \u00a0 select book.Title; Stay tuned to learn more in our upcoming excerpts. Of course, you can also get the full book immediately!Cross-posted from http://LinqInAction.net Posted: Sep 15 2007, 07:57 PM by Fabrice Marguerie | with 1 comment(s) Filed under: .NET, LINQ Comments Roger Jennings said: Pingback from oakleafblog.blogspot.com/.../linq-and-entity-framework-posts-for_15.html. # September 15, 2007 3:20 PM Leave a Comment Title (required)\u00a0 Name (required)\u00a0 Your URL (optional) Comments (required)\u00a0 Remember Me?

It describes how one can use Apache's mod_rewrite to solve typical URL-based problems with which webmasters are commonly confronted. We give detailed descriptions on how to solve each problem by configuring URL rewriting rulesets. ATTENTION: Depending on your server configuration it may be necessary to adjust the examples for your situation, e.g., adding the [PT] flag if using mod_alias and mod_userdir, etc. Or rewriting a ruleset to work in .htaccess context instead of per-server context. Always try to understand what a particular ruleset really does before you use it; this avoids many problems. Web Cluster with Consistent URL Space Structured Homedirs Filesystem Reorganization Redirect Failing URLs to Another Web Server Archive Access Multiplexer Content Handling Access Restriction See alsoModule documentationmod_rewrite introductionTechnical details Web Cluster with Consistent URL Space Description: We want to create a homogeneous and consistent URL layout across all WWW servers on an Intranet web cluster, i.e., all URLs (by definition server-local and thus server-dependent!) become server independent! What we want is to give the WWW namespace a single consistent layout: no URL should refer to any particular target server. The cluster itself should connect users automatically to a physical target host as needed, invisibly. Solution: First, the knowledge of the target servers comes from (distributed) external maps which contain information on where our users, groups, and entities reside. They have the form: user1 server_of_user1 user2 server_of_user2 : : We put them into files map.xxx-to-host. Second we need to instruct all servers to redirect URLs of the forms: /u/user/anypath /g/group/anypath /e/entity/anypath to http://physical-host/u/user/anypath http://physical-host/g/group/anypath http://physical-host/e/entity/anypath when any URL path need not be valid on every server. The following ruleset does this for us with the help of the map files (assuming that server0 is a default server which will be used if a user has no entry in the map): RewriteEngine on RewriteMap user-to-host txt:/path/to/map.user-to-host RewriteMap group-to-host txt:/path/to/map.group-to-host RewriteMap entity-to-host txt:/path/to/map.entity-to-host RewriteRule ^/u/([^/]+)/?(.*) http://${user-to-host:$1|server0}/u/$1/$2 RewriteRule ^/g/([^/]+)/?(.*) http://${group-to-host:$1|server0}/g/$1/$2 RewriteRule ^/e/([^/]+)/?(.*) http://${entity-to-host:$1|server0}/e/$1/$2 RewriteRule ^/([uge])/([^/]+)/?$ /$1/$2/.www/ RewriteRule ^/([uge])/([^/]+)/([^.]+.+) /$1/$2/.www/$3\\ Structured Homedirs Description: Some sites with thousands of users use a structured homedir layout, i.e. each homedir is in a subdirectory which begins (for instance) with the first character of the username. So, /~foo/anypath is /home/f/foo/.www/anypath while /~bar/anypath is /home/b/bar/.www/anypath. Solution: We use the following ruleset to expand the tilde URLs into the above layout. RewriteEngine on RewriteRule ^/~(([a-z])[a-z0-9]+)(.*) /home/$2/$1/.www$3 Filesystem Reorganization Description: This really is a hardcore example: a killer application which heavily uses per-directory RewriteRules to get a smooth look and feel on the Web while its data structure is never touched or adjusted. Background: net.sw is my archive of freely available Unix software packages, which I started to collect in 1992. It is both my hobby and job to do this, because while I'm studying computer science I have also worked for many years as a system and network administrator in my spare time. Every week I need some sort of software so I created a deep hierarchy of directories where I stored the packages: drwxrwxr-x 2 netsw users 512 Aug 3 18:39 Audio/ drwxrwxr-x 2 netsw users 512 Jul 9 14:37 Benchmark/ drwxrwxr-x 12 netsw users 512 Jul 9 00:34 Crypto/ drwxrwxr-x 5 netsw users 512 Jul 9 00:41 Database/ drwxrwxr-x 4 netsw users 512 Jul 30 19:25 Dicts/ drwxrwxr-x 10 netsw users 512 Jul 9 01:54 Graphic/ drwxrwxr-x 5 netsw users 512 Jul 9 01:58 Hackers/ drwxrwxr-x 8 netsw users 512 Jul 9 03:19 InfoSys/ drwxrwxr-x 3 netsw users 512 Jul 9 03:21 Math/ drwxrwxr-x 3 netsw users 512 Jul 9 03:24 Misc/ drwxrwxr-x 9 netsw users 512 Aug 1 16:33 Network/ drwxrwxr-x 2 netsw users 512 Jul 9 05:53 Office/ drwxrwxr-x 7 netsw users 512 Jul 9 09:24 SoftEng/ drwxrwxr-x 7 netsw users 512 Jul 9 12:17 System/ drwxrwxr-x 12 netsw users 512 Aug 3 20:15 Typesetting/ drwxrwxr-x 10 netsw users 512 Jul 9 14:08 X11/ In July 1996 I decided to make this archive public to the world via a nice Web interface. \"Nice\" means that I wanted to offer an interface where you can browse directly through the archive hierarchy. And \"nice\" means that I didn't want to change anything inside this hierarchy - not even by putting some CGI scripts at the top of it. Why? Because the above structure should later be accessible via FTP as well, and I didn't want any Web or CGI stuff mixed in there. Solution: The solution has two parts: The first is a set of CGI scripts which create all the pages at all directory levels on-the-fly. I put them under /e/netsw/.www/ as follows: -rw-r--r-- 1 netsw users 1318 Aug 1 18:10 .wwwacl drwxr-xr-x 18 netsw users 512 Aug 5 15:51 DATA/ -rw-rw-rw- 1 netsw users 372982 Aug 5 16:35 LOGFILE -rw-r--r-- 1 netsw users 659 Aug 4 09:27 TODO -rw-r--r-- 1 netsw users 5697 Aug 1 18:01 netsw-about.html -rwxr-xr-x 1 netsw users 579 Aug 2 10:33 netsw-access.pl -rwxr-xr-x 1 netsw users 1532 Aug 1 17:35 netsw-changes.cgi -rwxr-xr-x 1 netsw users 2866 Aug 5 14:49 netsw-home.cgi drwxr-xr-x 2 netsw users 512 Jul 8 23:47 netsw-img/ -rwxr-xr-x 1 netsw users 24050 Aug 5 15:49 netsw-lsdir.cgi -rwxr-xr-x 1 netsw users 1589 Aug 3 18:43 netsw-search.cgi -rwxr-xr-x 1 netsw users 1885 Aug 1 17:41 netsw-tree.cgi -rw-r--r-- 1 netsw users 234 Jul 30 16:35 netsw-unlimit.lst The DATA/ subdirectory holds the above directory structure, i.e. the real net.sw stuff, and gets automatically updated via rdist from time to time. The second part of the problem remains: how to link these two structures together into one smooth-looking URL tree? We want to hide the DATA/ directory from the user while running the appropriate CGI scripts for the various URLs. Here is the solution: first I put the following into the per-directory configuration file in the DocumentRoot of the server to rewrite the public URL path /net.sw/ to the internal path /e/netsw: RewriteRule ^net.sw$ net.sw/ [R] RewriteRule ^net.sw/(.*)$ e/netsw/$1 The first rule is for requests which miss the trailing slash! The second rule does the real thing. And then comes the killer configuration which stays in the per-directory config file /e/netsw/.www/.wwwacl: Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks Includes MultiViews RewriteEngine on # we are reached via /net.sw/ prefix RewriteBase /net.sw/ # first we rewrite the root dir to # the handling cgi script RewriteRule ^$ netsw-home.cgi [L] RewriteRule ^index\\.html$ netsw-home.cgi [L] # strip out the subdirs when # the browser requests us from perdir pages RewriteRule ^.+/(netsw-[^/]+/.+)$ $1 [L] # and now break the rewriting for local files RewriteRule ^netsw-home\\.cgi.* - [L] RewriteRule ^netsw-changes\\.cgi.* - [L] RewriteRule ^netsw-search\\.cgi.* - [L] RewriteRule ^netsw-tree\\.cgi$ - [L] RewriteRule ^netsw-about\\.html$ - [L] RewriteRule ^netsw-img/.*$ - [L] # anything else is a subdir which gets handled # by another cgi script RewriteRule !^netsw-lsdir\\.cgi.* - [C] RewriteRule (.*) netsw-lsdir.cgi/$1 Some hints for interpretation: Notice the L (last) flag and no substitution field ('-') in the fourth part Notice the ! (not) character and the C (chain) flag at the first rule in the last part Notice the catch-all pattern in the last rule Redirect Failing URLs to Another Web Server Description: A typical FAQ about URL rewriting is how to redirect failing requests on webserver A to webserver B. Usually this is done via ErrorDocument CGI scripts in Perl, but there is also a mod_rewrite solution. But note that this performs more poorly than using an ErrorDocument CGI script! Solution: The first solution has the best performance but less flexibility, and is less safe: RewriteEngine on RewriteCond /your/docroot/%{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteRule ^(.+) http://webserverB.dom/$1 The problem here is that this will only work for pages inside the DocumentRoot. While you can add more Conditions (for instance to also handle homedirs, etc.) there is a better variant: RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !-U RewriteRule ^(.+) http://webserverB.dom/$1 This uses the URL look-ahead feature of mod_rewrite. The result is that this will work for all types of URLs and is safe. But it does have a performance impact on the web server, because for every request there is one more internal subrequest. So, if your web server runs on a powerful CPU, use this one. If it is a slow machine, use the first approach or better an ErrorDocument CGI script. Archive Access Multiplexer Description: Do you know the great CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) under http://www.perl.com/CPAN? CPAN automatically redirects browsers to one of many FTP servers around the world (generally one near the requesting client); each server carries a full CPAN mirror. This is effectively an FTP access multiplexing service. CPAN runs via CGI scripts, but how could a similar approach be implemented via mod_rewrite? Solution: First we notice that as of version 3.0.0, mod_rewrite can also use the \"ftp:\" scheme on redirects. And second, the location approximation can be done by a RewriteMap over the top-level domain of the client. With a tricky chained ruleset we can use this top-level domain as a key to our multiplexing map. RewriteEngine on RewriteMap multiplex txt:/path/to/map.cxan RewriteRule ^/CxAN/(.*) %{REMOTE_HOST}::$1 [C] RewriteRule ^.+\\.([a-zA-Z]+)::(.*)$ ${multiplex:$1|ftp.default.dom}$2 [R,L] ## ## map.cxan -- Multiplexing Map for CxAN ## de ftp://ftp.cxan.de/CxAN/ uk ftp://ftp.cxan.uk/CxAN/ com ftp://ftp.cxan.com/CxAN/ : ##EOF## Content Handling Browser Dependent Content Description: At least for important top-level pages it is sometimes necessary to provide the optimum of browser dependent content, i.e., one has to provide one version for current browsers, a different version for the Lynx and text-mode browsers, and another for other browsers. Solution: We cannot use content negotiation because the browsers do not provide their type in that form. Instead we have to act on the HTTP header \"User-Agent\". The following config does the following: If the HTTP header \"User-Agent\" begins with \"Mozilla/3\", the page foo.html is rewritten to foo.NS.html and the rewriting stops. If the browser is \"Lynx\" or \"Mozilla\" of version 1 or 2, the URL becomes foo.20.html. All other browsers receive page foo.32.html. This is done with the following ruleset: RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^Mozilla/3.* RewriteRule ^foo\\.html$ foo.NS.html [L] RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^Lynx/.* [OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^Mozilla/[12].* RewriteRule ^foo\\.html$ foo.20.html [L] RewriteRule ^foo\\.html$ foo.32.html [L] Dynamic Mirror Description: Assume there are nice web pages on remote hosts we want to bring into our namespace. For FTP servers we would use the mirror program which actually maintains an explicit up-to-date copy of the remote data on the local machine. For a web server we could use the program webcopy which runs via HTTP. But both techniques have a major drawback: The local copy is always only as up-to-date as the last time we ran the program. It would be much better if the mirror was not a static one we have to establish explicitly. Instead we want a dynamic mirror with data which gets updated automatically as needed on the remote host(s). Solution: To provide this feature we map the remote web page or even the complete remote web area to our namespace by the use of the Proxy Throughput feature (flag [P]): RewriteEngine on RewriteBase /~quux/ RewriteRule ^hotsheet/(.*)$ http://www.tstimpreso.com/hotsheet/$1 [P] RewriteEngine on RewriteBase /~quux/ RewriteRule ^usa-news\\.html$ http://www.quux-corp.com/news/index.html [P] Reverse Dynamic Mirror Description: ... Solution: RewriteEngine on RewriteCond /mirror/of/remotesite/$1 -U RewriteRule ^http://www\\.remotesite\\.com/(.*)$ /mirror/of/remotesite/$1 Retrieve Missing Data from Intranet Description: This is a tricky way of virtually running a corporate (external) Internet web server (www.quux-corp.dom), while actually keeping and maintaining its data on an (internal) Intranet web server (www2.quux-corp.dom) which is protected by a firewall. The trick is that the external web server retrieves the requested data on-the-fly from the internal one. Solution: First, we must make sure that our firewall still protects the internal web server and only the external web server is allowed to retrieve data from it. On a packet-filtering firewall, for instance, we could configure a firewall ruleset like the following: ALLOW Host www.quux-corp.dom Port >1024 --> Host www2.quux-corp.dom Port 80 DENY Host * Port * --> Host www2.quux-corp.dom Port 80 Just adjust it to your actual configuration syntax. Now we can establish the mod_rewrite rules which request the missing data in the background through the proxy throughput feature: RewriteRule ^/~([^/]+)/?(.*) /home/$1/.www/$2 RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule ^/home/([^/]+)/.www/?(.*) http://www2.quux-corp.dom/~$1/pub/$2 [P] Load Balancing Description: Suppose we want to load balance the traffic to www.foo.com over www[0-5].foo.com (a total of 6 servers). How can this be done? Solution: There are many possible solutions for this problem. We will first discuss a common DNS-based method, and then one based on mod_rewrite: DNS Round-Robin The simplest method for load-balancing is to use DNS round-robin. Here you just configure www[0-9].foo.com as usual in your DNS with A (address) records, e.g., www0 IN A 1.2.3.1 www1 IN A 1.2.3.2 www2 IN A 1.2.3.3 www3 IN A 1.2.3.4 www4 IN A 1.2.3.5 www5 IN A 1.2.3.6 Then you additionally add the following entries: www IN A 1.2.3.1 www IN A 1.2.3.2 www IN A 1.2.3.3 www IN A 1.2.3.4 www IN A 1.2.3.5 Now when www.foo.com gets resolved, BIND gives out www0-www5 - but in a permutated (rotated) order every time. This way the clients are spread over the various servers. But notice that this is not a perfect load balancing scheme, because DNS resolutions are cached by clients and other nameservers, so once a client has resolved www.foo.com to a particular wwwN.foo.com, all its subsequent requests will continue to go to the same IP (and thus a single server), rather than being distributed across the other available servers. But the overall result is okay because the requests are collectively spread over the various web servers. DNS Load-Balancing A sophisticated DNS-based method for load-balancing is to use the program lbnamed which can be found at http://www.stanford.edu/~schemers/docs/lbnamed/lbnamed.html. It is a Perl 5 program which, in conjunction with auxilliary tools, provides real load-balancing via DNS. Proxy Throughput Round-Robin In this variant we use mod_rewrite and its proxy throughput feature. First we dedicate www0.foo.com to be actually www.foo.com by using a single www IN CNAME www0.foo.com. entry in the DNS. Then we convert www0.foo.com to a proxy-only server, i.e., we configure this machine so all arriving URLs are simply passed through its internal proxy to one of the 5 other servers (www1-www5). To accomplish this we first establish a ruleset which contacts a load balancing script lb.pl for all URLs. RewriteEngine on RewriteMap lb prg:/path/to/lb.pl RewriteRule ^/(.+)$ ${lb:$1} [P,L] Then we write lb.pl: #!/path/to/perl ## ## lb.pl -- load balancing script ## $| = 1; $name = \"www\"; # the hostname base $first = 1; # the first server (not 0 here, because 0 is myself) $last = 5; # the last server in the round-robin $domain = \"foo.dom\"; # the domainname $cnt = 0; while (<STDIN>) { $cnt = (($cnt+1) % ($last+1-$first)); $server = sprintf(\"%s%d.%s\", $name, $cnt+$first, $domain); print \"http://$server/$_\"; } ##EOF## A last notice: Why is this useful? Seems like www0.foo.com still is overloaded? The answer is yes, it is overloaded, but with plain proxy throughput requests, only! All SSI, CGI, ePerl, etc. processing is handled done on the other machines. For a complicated site, this may work well. The biggest risk here is that www0 is now a single point of failure -- if it crashes, the other servers are inaccessible. Dedicated Load Balancers There are more sophisticated solutions, as well. Cisco, F5, and several other companies sell hardware load balancers (typically used in pairs for redundancy), which offer sophisticated load balancing and auto-failover features. There are software packages which offer similar features on commodity hardware, as well. If you have enough money or need, check these out. The lb-l mailing list is a good place to research. New MIME-type, New Service Description: On the net there are many nifty CGI programs. But their usage is usually boring, so a lot of webmasters don't use them. Even Apache's Action handler feature for MIME-types is only appropriate when the CGI programs don't need special URLs (actually PATH_INFO and QUERY_STRINGS) as their input. First, let us configure a new file type with extension .scgi (for secure CGI) which will be processed by the popular cgiwrap program. The problem here is that for instance if we use a Homogeneous URL Layout (see above) a file inside the user homedirs might have a URL like /u/user/foo/bar.scgi, but cgiwrap needs URLs in the form /~user/foo/bar.scgi/. The following rule solves the problem: RewriteRule ^/[uge]/([^/]+)/\\.www/(.+)\\.scgi(.*) ... ... /internal/cgi/user/cgiwrap/~$1/$2.scgi$3 [NS,T=application/x-http-cgi] Or assume we have some more nifty programs: wwwlog (which displays the access.log for a URL subtree) and wwwidx (which runs Glimpse on a URL subtree). We have to provide the URL area to these programs so they know which area they are really working with. But usually this is complicated, because they may still be requested by the alternate URL form, i.e., typically we would run the swwidx program from within /u/user/foo/ via hyperlink to /internal/cgi/user/swwidx?i=/u/user/foo/ which is ugly, because we have to hard-code both the location of the area and the location of the CGI inside the hyperlink. When we have to reorganize, we spend a lot of time changing the various hyperlinks. Solution: The solution here is to provide a special new URL format which automatically leads to the proper CGI invocation. We configure the following: RewriteRule ^/([uge])/([^/]+)(/?.*)/\\* /internal/cgi/user/wwwidx?i=/$1/$2$3/ RewriteRule ^/([uge])/([^/]+)(/?.*):log /internal/cgi/user/wwwlog?f=/$1/$2$3 Now the hyperlink to search at /u/user/foo/ reads only HREF=\"*\" which internally gets automatically transformed to /internal/cgi/user/wwwidx?i=/u/user/foo/ The same approach leads to an invocation for the access log CGI program when the hyperlink :log gets used. On-the-fly Content-Regeneration Description: Here comes a really esoteric feature: Dynamically generated but statically served pages, i.e., pages should be delivered as pure static pages (read from the filesystem and just passed through), but they have to be generated dynamically by the web server if missing. This way you can have CGI-generated pages which are statically served unless an admin (or a cron job) removes the static contents. Then the contents gets refreshed. Solution: This is done via the following ruleset: RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-s RewriteRule ^page\\.html$ page.cgi [T=application/x-httpd-cgi,L] Here a request for page.html leads to an internal run of a corresponding page.cgi if page.html is missing or has filesize null. The trick here is that page.cgi is a CGI script which (additionally to its STDOUT) writes its output to the file page.html. Once it has completed, the server sends out page.html. When the webmaster wants to force a refresh of the contents, he just removes page.html (typically from cron). Document With Autorefresh Description: Wouldn't it be nice, while creating a complex web page, if the web browser would automatically refresh the page every time we save a new version from within our editor? Impossible? Solution: No! We just combine the MIME multipart feature, the web server NPH feature, and the URL manipulation power of mod_rewrite. First, we establish a new URL feature: Adding just :refresh to any URL causes the 'page' to be refreshed every time it is updated on the filesystem. RewriteRule ^(/[uge]/[^/]+/?.*):refresh /internal/cgi/apache/nph-refresh?f=$1 Now when we reference the URL /u/foo/bar/page.html:refresh this leads to the internal invocation of the URL /internal/cgi/apache/nph-refresh?f=/u/foo/bar/page.html The only missing part is the NPH-CGI script. Although one would usually say \"left as an exercise to the reader\" ;-) I will provide this, too. #!/sw/bin/perl ## ## nph-refresh -- NPH/CGI script for auto refreshing pages ## Copyright (c) 1997 Ralf S.

But when you are an ISP and have hundreds of virtual hosts, this feature is suboptimal. Solution: To provide this feature we map the remote web page or even the complete remote web area to our namespace using the Proxy Throughput feature (flag [P]): ## ## vhost.map ## www.vhost1.dom:80 /path/to/docroot/vhost1 www.vhost2.dom:80 /path/to/docroot/vhost2 : www.vhostN.dom:80 /path/to/docroot/vhostN ## ## httpd.conf ## : # use the canonical hostname on redirects, etc. UseCanonicalName on : # add the virtual host in front of the CLF-format CustomLog /path/to/access_log \"%{VHOST}e %h %l %u %t \\\"%r\\\" %>s %b\" : # enable the rewriting engine in the main server RewriteEngine on # define two maps: one for fixing the URL and one which defines # the available virtual hosts with their corresponding # DocumentRoot. RewriteMap lowercase int:tolower RewriteMap vhost txt:/path/to/vhost.map # Now do the actual virtual host mapping # via a huge and complicated single rule: # # 1. make sure we don't map for common locations RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/commonurl1/.* RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/commonurl2/.* : RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/commonurlN/.* # # 2. make sure we have a Host header, because # currently our approach only supports # virtual hosting through this header RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^$ # # 3. lowercase the hostname RewriteCond ${lowercase:%{HTTP_HOST}|NONE} ^(.+)$ # # 4. lookup this hostname in vhost.map and # remember it only when it is a path # (and not \"NONE\" from above) RewriteCond ${vhost:%1} ^(/.*)$ # # 5. finally we can map the URL to its docroot location # and remember the virtual host for logging purposes RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ %1/$1 [E=VHOST:${lowercase:%{HTTP_HOST}}] : Access Restriction Host Deny Description: How can we forbid a list of externally configured hosts from using our server? Solution: For Apache >= 1.3b6: RewriteEngine on RewriteMap hosts-deny txt:/path/to/hosts.deny RewriteCond ${hosts-deny:%{REMOTE_HOST}|NOT-FOUND} !=NOT-FOUND [OR] RewriteCond ${hosts-deny:%{REMOTE_ADDR}|NOT-FOUND} !=NOT-FOUND RewriteRule ^/.* - [F] For Apache <= 1.3b6: RewriteEngine on RewriteMap hosts-deny txt:/path/to/hosts.deny RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ ${hosts-deny:%{REMOTE_HOST}|NOT-FOUND}/$1 RewriteRule !^NOT-FOUND/.* - [F] RewriteRule ^NOT-FOUND/(.*)$ ${hosts-deny:%{REMOTE_ADDR}|NOT-FOUND}/$1 RewriteRule !^NOT-FOUND/.* - [F] RewriteRule ^NOT-FOUND/(.*)$ /$1 ## ## hosts.deny ## ## ATTENTION! This is a map, not a list, even when we treat it as such. ## mod_rewrite parses it for key/value pairs, so at least a ## dummy value \"-\" must be present for each entry. ## 193.102.180.41 - bsdti1.sdm.de - 192.76.162.40 - Proxy Deny Description: How can we forbid a certain host or even a user of a special host from using the Apache proxy? Solution: We first have to make sure mod_rewrite is below(!) mod_proxy in the Configuration file when compiling the Apache web server. This way it gets called before mod_proxy. Then we configure the following for a host-dependent deny... RewriteCond %{REMOTE_HOST} ^badhost\\.mydomain\\.com$ RewriteRule !^http://[^/.]\\.mydomain.com.* - [F] ...and this one for a user@host-dependent deny: RewriteCond %{REMOTE_IDENT}@%{REMOTE_HOST} ^badguy@badhost\\.mydomain\\.com$ RewriteRule !^http://[^/.]\\.mydomain.com.* - [F] Special Authentication Variant Description: Sometimes very special authentication is needed, for instance authentication which checks for a set of explicitly configured users. Only these should receive access and without explicit prompting (which would occur when using Basic Auth via mod_auth). Solution: We use a list of rewrite conditions to exclude all except our friends: RewriteCond %{REMOTE_IDENT}@%{REMOTE_HOST} !^friend1@client1.quux-corp\\.com$ RewriteCond %{REMOTE_IDENT}@%{REMOTE_HOST} !^friend2@client2.quux-corp\\.com$ RewriteCond %{REMOTE_IDENT}@%{REMOTE_HOST} !^friend3@client3.quux-corp\\.com$ RewriteRule ^/~quux/only-for-friends/ - [F] Referer-based Deflector Description: How can we program a flexible URL Deflector which acts on the \"Referer\" HTTP header and can be configured with as many referring pages as we like? Solution: Use the following really tricky ruleset... RewriteMap deflector txt:/path/to/deflector.map RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !=\"\" RewriteCond ${deflector:%{HTTP_REFERER}} ^-$ RewriteRule ^.* %{HTTP_REFERER} [R,L] RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !=\"\" RewriteCond ${deflector:%{HTTP_REFERER}|NOT-FOUND} !=NOT-FOUND RewriteRule ^.* ${deflector:%{HTTP_REFERER}} [R,L] ... in conjunction with a corresponding rewrite map: ## ## deflector.map ## http://www.badguys.com/bad/index.html - http://www.badguys.com/bad/index2.html - http://www.badguys.com/bad/index3.html http://somewhere.com/ This automatically redirects the request back to the referring page (when \"-\" is used as the value in the map) or to a specific URL (when an URL is specified in the map as the second argument).

Better utilize content server resources. Facilitate application deployment including pilot management and A/B testing. Lower management costs and create opportunities for shared hosters. ARR\u00a0relies on the\u00a0URL rewrite module to inspect incoming HTTP requests to make the routing decisions. Therefore, the URL rewrite module is required to enable ARR features. ARR support is provided by Microsoft Help and Support.\u00a0The forum will remain active. Features Microsoft Application Request Routing for IIS 7 includes the following key features: HTTP-based routing decisionsUnlike hardware load balancers that make routing decisions at the IP level, ARR makes routing decisions at the application level.\u00a0 By using ARR with the\u00a0URL rewrite module, you can write powerful routing rules\u00a0that are\u00a0based on HTTP headers and server variables. Load balance algorithmsYou can apply\u00a0a user-selected load balance algorithm to determine which content server is most appropriate to service HTTP requests.\u00a0Six algorithms are provided. Health monitoringYou can use both live traffic and specific URL tests to determine the health of content servers.\u00a0A set of configuration parameters are provided to define the meaning of server health.\u00a0You can\u00a0also disable both live traffic and URL tests and use a custom health monitoring provider. To do this, set the health of the servers by calling RSCA APIs. Client affinityBy using a cookie, ARR can affinitize all requests from a client to a content server.\u00a0ARR differentiates the clients behind NAT, so each client is treated independently.\u00a0This feature requires that the clients are able to accept cookies. Host name affinity\u201cHost name affinity\u201d is a specific feature for shared hosters.\u00a0This feature\u00a0changes the deployment topology to minimize and streamline administration and to create additional business opportunities.\u00a0For more information\u00a0about this scenario, see Shared Hosting Deployment using Application Request Routing.\u00a0Two providers, round robin and memory, are used to determine to which server the host should be affinitized. Multiple server groupsARR can manage multiple server groups, which are logical groupings of content servers in an environment. This feature allows ARR to be used in pilot management and A/B testing scenarios. Management and monitoring by using the UIYou can use IIS Manager to manage and view all configuration settings and aggregated runtime statistics\u00a0for ARR. Failed request tracing rulesSpecific traces have been added to quickly troubleshoot and diagnose ARR.

Hipmunk, Flight Search iPhone\u00a0App\u00a0\u2605 Saw this app mentioned on Mashable and gave it a try. I\u2019m very impressed. It\u2019s not just a good experience for flight search for a phone, it\u2019s a good experience for flight search period. I used it to book my flights for WWDC, and I\u2019d rather use this app on my 3.5-inch iPhone than most flight search websites on my full-size Mac display. Hipmunk\u2019s \u201cagony\u201d filter produces a seemingly ideal sort order. And their custom date picker is simply brilliant. Hipmunk has a good web interface too, but it has nothing on the iPhone interface. This is why native apps matter. Fugly Android\u00a0\u2605 Via the \u201cAndroidPR\u201d Twitter account. On WWDC Now Being\u00a0\u2018Broken\u2019\u00a0\u2605 Jeff LaMarche, on criticism that Apple should somehow expand WWDC to something like Oracle OpenWorld: Making WWDC more like these giant, soulless, \u201centerprise\u201d conferences is not the answer. Scaling WWDC to 10k, 20k or 40k is fixing the problem by shooting the golden goose. Trying to scale up WWDC like that would utterly destroy everything that is wonderful about it. It sucks that demand now outstrips supply for WWDC tickets, but I\u2019m with LaMarche: I don\u2019t see any way for Apple to change this other than by ruining what it is that makes WWDC great. It\u2019s the \u201cjust keep selling more and more conference passes each year because demand keeps increasing\u201d strategy that has watered down SXSW. Update: It occurs to me that Apple did make a major change to help those who don\u2019t or can\u2019t attend WWDC: they release the session videos remarkably soon after the conference ends. Watching the videos is not the same thing as being there (no labs, for one thing), but it\u2019s a big improvement over years past, when the videos were released many months after WWDC was over. Great Example\u00a0\u2605 Embarrassingly bad piece by Steve Lohr for the NYT, on the rise of HTML5 web apps: \u201cRight now, we\u2019re in a native apps world,\u201d says John Lilly, a venture partner at Greylock Partners, a venture capital firm in Silicon Valley. \u201cBut people are underestimating the power of the Web. I think we\u2019re going to see an explosion of Web-based apps over the next couple of years.\u201d Indeed, start-up companies like Zite and Flipboard present media content in magazine-style pages on the iPad, using HTML5. The free software from Flipboard, for example, taps a user\u2019s online social networks for reading recommendations. Flipboard is also working with publishers, offering them tools for automating the display of pages on the iPad. First, no disclaimer that Lilly was CEO of the Mozilla Corporation until May of last year. Second, how is Flipboard an example of a web app? It\u2019s a native iOS app in the App Store. It uses HTML5 and web content views, sure, but it\u2019s still a native iPad app. (Via Kontra.) Monday, 28 March 2011 WWDC 2011 Sells Out in Under 12\u00a0Hours\u00a0\u2605 Serenity Caldwell, for Macworld: While WWDC has been selling out before its opening day since 2008, this year\u2019s speedy turnaround is particularly noteworthy: Apple\u2019s conference last year in 2010 took eight days to fill to capacity, while it took a whole month for the 2009 event to sell out. As previous conferences have primarily focused on either Apple\u2019s mobile or desktop OS, but never both, it\u2019s likely the promised double-whammy of available tracks for both the Mac and iOS attracted a much larger pool of developers than last year\u2019s iOS-centric conference. I don\u2019t know about that. I think it likely would have sold out in the same amount of time even if Apple\u2019s entire announcement had consisted of nothing but \u201cWWDC 2011 tickets are now on sale\u201d. This is the conference for the hottest development platform. David Worthington\u2019s Mom Reviews the iPad, Her First\u00a0Computer\u00a0\u2605 If you don\u2019t think this sort of perspective matters, you\u2019re nuts. Jack Dorsey Back at Twitter, Leading Product\u00a0Design\u00a0\u2605 Remember all the shit I got when I suggested that Ev Williams was forced out as CEO and that his new position as head of product was pure spin? Yeah. Jim Dalrymple: \u2018No iPhone, iPad, or Mac Hardware Coming at\u00a0WWDC\u2019\u00a0\u2605 Surprising, yes. But I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: Jim Dalrymple\u2019s sources at Apple are gold. WWDC 2011 on Sale\u00a0Now\u00a0\u2605 June 6-10. Last year\u2019s sold out in a few days. This year\u2019s slogan: \u201cJoin us for a preview of the future of iOS and Mac OS X\u201d \u2014 sounds like iOS 5 might not ship until later in the year. Apple\u2019s Web-Based App Store Guide for\u00a0iPhone\u00a0\u2605 The emphasis seems to be promoting iPhone-exclusive titles. Sunday, 27 March 2011 RIM: The Inmates Have Taken Over the\u00a0Asylum\u00a0\u2605 Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e: RIM reigned at a time when your Blackberry came with everything you needed. That\u2019s RIM\u2019s problem in a sentence. Epic Review of Color in the App\u00a0Store\u00a0\u2605 \u201cColor is a ground-breaking new entry in the new genre of MMPRLMG (Massive Multi-Player Real-Live Marketing Games).\u201d Saturday, 26 March 2011 Matt Drance Told Us RIM Was in\u00a0Trouble\u00a0\u2605 Matt Drance: RIM has\u00a0two CEOs and three COOs.\u00a0Why is anyone expecting straight answers from a company that can\u2019t even decide who\u2019s in charge? The Noyes Machine\u00a0\u2605 The Macalope on Katherine Noyes\u2019s bizarre anti-iPad crusade. Friday, 25 March 2011 Oh, Samsung\u00a0\u2605 Harry McCracken finds Samsung\u2019s tablet-thinness claims sketchy, and catches them using actors to portray purportedly real Galaxy Tab users. Good journalism. Harvest\u00a0\u2605 My thanks to Harvest for sponsoring this week\u2019s DF RSS feed. Harvest is a time tracking and invoicing web app that\u2019s perfect for freelancers and creative agencies. Designed with productivity and ease of use in mind, it\u2019s simple to track billable hours from the web or the desktop widget. Free iPhone and Android companion apps help you track time and expenses on the go. At the end of the month, turn your billable hours into invoices with just a few clicks. Harvest users include smart companies like Happy Cog and Adaptive Path. You can get started with Harvest with a free 30-day trial. Color Keeps Digging\u00a0\u2605 Color founder Bill Nguyen explains to Matt Rosoff that his company is misunderstood: Color is not about photo sharing. It\u2019s a new way to build spontaneous social networks \u2014 and collect massive amounts of data about what people are doing and where they\u2019re doing it \u2014 without collecting any personally identifiable information like last names, addresses, or even passwords. So it\u2019s a data mining trojan horse. Well, that changes everything. Who wouldn\u2019t love that? And it\u2019s a good thing personal photos have no \u201cpersonally identifiable information\u201d \u2014 you know, other than images of you, your friends, and your family. More Open\u00a0\u2605 J-P Teti: The iPad only does less than a regular computer to us geeks. To everyone else, it does more. This is what Motorola and Google and Samsung and BlackBerry and everyone else, with the sole exception of Apple, do not get about \u201copen\u201d computing. Astute analysis of the iPad to regular folks. \u2018It\u2019s Like Walking Through Sam Ash With Steve Jobs\u2019s\u00a0AmEx.\u2019\u00a0\u2605 Benjamin Jackson on GarageBand for iPad. The Talk Show, Episode\u00a035\u00a0\u2605 This week\u2019s episode of America\u2019s favorite podcast, with me talking about my new computer. Other topics: Bertrand Serlet, the Amazon Appstore, and Diamonds Are Forever. Brought to you by MailChimp. He Who Owns the\u00a0API\u00a0\u2605 Glenn Fleishman, writing for The Economist, on Amazon\u2019s back-and-forth with Lendle: But on Monday morning Amazon turned off the content tap that feeds the site; it was not switched on again until Tuesday evening. The brief outage demonstrates a fundamental truth about the internet: if you don\u2019t own the data you need to run your business, you\u2019re dependent on the policies \u2014 and whims \u2014 of the parties that do.\u00a0Jeff Croft,\u00a0Lendle\u2019s founder, says he will not make that mistake again. Really smart take on the story. Thursday, 24 March 2011 RIM Co-CEO on PlayBook\u2019s Support for Android\u00a0Apps\u00a0\u2605 Crystal clear. Color: Breathlessly Overhyped Piece of\u00a0Crap\u00a0\u2605 Color is a new location-based social photo-sharing app for the iPhone and Android. Or something. I installed it and couldn\u2019t make heads or tails out of it, and even if I could figure out the app, I can\u2019t see why I\u2019d ever want to use such a service. Yet it was somehow the biggest story in tech news circles today. E.g.: \u201cColor Looks to Reinvent Social Interaction\u201d? Really? This thing looks like a turd to me. Now, maybe I\u2019m the idiot and the joke\u2019s on me and Color is going to be a huge hit. But my figurative money says that the investors who funded these guys just flushed $41 million in literal money down the toilet. Nice domain name, though. BlackBerry PlayBook to Include Support for Android and Java\u00a0Apps\u00a0\u2605 RIM: RIM will launch two optional \u201capp players\u201d that provide an application run-time environment for BlackBerry Java apps and Android v2.3 apps. These new app players will allow users to download BlackBerry Java apps and Android apps from BlackBerry App World and run them on their BlackBerry PlayBook. In addition, RIM will shortly release the native SDK for the BlackBerry PlayBook enabling C/C++ application development on the BlackBerry\u00ae Tablet OS. For game-specific developers, RIM is also announcing that it has gained support from two leading game development tooling companies, allowing developers to use the cross-platform game engines from Ideaworks Labs and Unity Technologies to bring their games to the BlackBerry PlayBook. These options are in addition to RIM\u2019s previously announced Tablet OS SDKs for Adobe Air and HTML5 web apps. So here\u2019s the question. Which one of these is the native SDK for the PlayBook. Which one\u2019s best? What is RIM\u2019s advice for how developers should write PlayBook apps? Google Not Releasing Honeycomb Source Code \u2018For the Foreseeable\u00a0Future\u2019\u00a0\u2605 Ashlee Vance and Brad Stone, reporting for Businessweek: Google says it will delay the distribution of its newest Android source code, dubbed Honeycomb, at least for the foreseeable future. The search giant says the software, which is tailored specifically for tablet computers that compete against Apple\u2019s iPad, is not yet ready to be altered by outside programmers and customized for other devices, such as phones. Guess we need a new definition of \u201copen\u201d. I\u2019ll Show You a\u00a0Fad\u00a0\u2605 Once people see one in person, they want one. \u2018Just a Fad\u2019\u00a0\u2605 PCWorld\u2019s Katherine Noyes says \u201ctablets are just a fad\u201d: Yet strong sales are backing up the hype \u2014 at least for now \u2014 suggesting something about the devices has caught on with consumers. What is that mysterious \u201csomething\u201d? Purely marketing, I believe. Apple is nothing if not master of the glitzy sales pitch, and there\u2019s never been better proof of that than the iPad\u2019s current success. Mark my words: The device \u2014 and all the others of its ilk that have sprung up for a piece of the action \u2014 are nothing more than a passing fad, at least in the mainstream. Words marked. On Working for Bertrand\u00a0Serlet\u00a0\u2605 David C\u00e1sseres: Pretty soon he was standing up in front of seasoned Apple software engineers and lecturing us on how not to make mistakes when cutting and pasting code. I said at that time that I had never felt so thoroughly disrespected as an engineer in my entire career. The NeXT/Apple culture wars were at their height. Seems like ancient history now, but the NeXT/Apple engineering cultures did not mix well at first. Oh, I Believe\u00a0It\u00a0\u2605 NYT publisher Arthur Sulzberger, on circumventing their new pay wall: \u201cCan people go around the system?\u201d Sulzberger asked during an appearance at The Paley Center for Media here. \u201cThe answer is yes. There are going to be ways. Just as if you run down Sixth Avenue right now and you pass a newsstand and grab the paper and keep running you can actually get the Times free,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to accept that. Is it going to be easy? No. Is it going to be done by the kind of people who buy the quality news and opinion of the New York Times? We don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be mostly high school kids and people out of work,\u201d Sulzberger said, before adding \u201cI can\u2019t believe I said that.\u201d Malick\u2019s \u2018Tree of Life\u2019 Set for\u00a0Cannes\u00a0\u2605 Justin Chang, Variety: A full year after it was initially floated as a hot fest prospect, Terrence Malick\u2019s \u201cThe Tree of Life\u201d is set to make its world premiere in May at the Cannes Film Festival. Who\u2019s up for a trip to France? Wednesday, 23 March 2011 John Paczkowski on Bertrand Serlet\u2019s Departure From\u00a0Apple\u00a0\u2605 John Paczkowski: There\u2019s a reason Craig Federighi, who is to take over Serlet\u2019s role, handled demo duties for Apple\u2019s Lion preview demo last year (see video below). And there\u2019s a reason Serlet has been selling off Apple shares recently. They\u2019ve been preparing for this day, which sources tell me is not at all the result of a spat over differences in strategic direction or the diminishment of OS X\u2019s importance to Apple. \u201cThere\u2019s no acrimony there,\u201d one source close to the company told me. \u201cBertrand\u2019s just decided it\u2019s his time to move on. Avie (Tevanian, former senior vice president of software engineering) handed off to him and now he\u2019s handing off to Craig. It\u2019s just a changing of the guard.\u201d Lendle Is Back\u00a0\u2605 Lendle: Late today, we received an email from an Associates Account Specialist at Amazon informing us that their concern only relates to our Book Sync tool, which syncs a user\u2019s Kindle books with their Lendle account. Amazon informed us that if we disabled this feature, our access to the api, as well as our Amazon Associates account, would be reinstated. We appreciate Amazon\u2019s willingness to modify the position stated in the original access revocation email and work with us to get Lendle back on line. We have complied with the request to disable the Book Sync tool (which was a very useful, but non-essential, feature of\u00a0Lendle). Bertrand Serlet on\u00a0Vista\u00a0\u2605 So funny. Bertrand Serlet to Leave\u00a0Apple\u00a0\u2605 He\u2019s one of the good guys. It\u2019s hard to overstate how influential he\u2019s been in the creation of the core OS and Cocoa libraries. He\u2019s been building, revising, iterating, and improving this system since 1989. Tuesday, 22 March 2011 Touring the Amazon\u00a0Appstore\u00a0\u2605 Justin Williams is on fire lately. Great overview of the Amazon Appstore experience. Dan Frommer on How Amazon Could Become a Tablet\u00a0Player\u00a0\u2605 Dan Frommer makes the case for Amazon as a potential tablet competitor. This tweet by Jeff Kibuule makes the case succinctly: Amazon is the only other company than Apple with a complete ecosystem of movies, music, apps, and web. And, of course, user accounts backed by credit cards. One problem seemingly no one addresses in reviews of Android tablets is how one is supposed to, say, load them up with a movie or two for an airplane trip. Google has no answer for that. Amazon could. Eight Easy Steps\u00a0\u2605 Justin Williams on the process of installing the Amazon Appstore on your Android device: There should never be an eight step installation process in mobile computing. Unless Amazon is able to net a killer, exclusive application that\u2019s unavailable anywhere else, I am hard-pressed to find any logic or reason why this will succeed. I think this is Amazon\u2019s first step towards launching their own Amazon-branded (or perhaps Kindle-branded) Android devices, where the Amazon Appstore will be preinstalled, and the devices will ship from Amazon with your Amazon credentials already set up on the device (as with the Kindle hardware today). They\u2019re launching now, for existing Android devices, to work out the kinks and build the library of available titles. Even with the arduous installation process for existing Android devices, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Amazon\u2019s store soon surpasses Google\u2019s Android Market. Amazon knows how to sell digital content; Google doesn\u2019t. Amazon Appstore for\u00a0Android\u00a0\u2605 \u201cAppstore\u201d, closed up, looks weird to me, but perhaps it\u2019s a bit of defense against Apple\u2019s trademark lawsuit over \u201capp store\u201d. Everyday 1.0\u00a0\u2605 Speaking of cool new apps with Sandwich videos: Everyday, an iPhone app for taking daily pictures of yourself and then, after you\u2019ve accumulated a bunch of them, putting them together into a \u201clooking at me, getting older and getting haircuts and shit\u201d time-lapse video. $1.99 on the App Store. A Rule of Thumb: Pricing Should Be\u00a0Simple Monday, 21 March 2011 One thing many companies \u2014 in any industry \u2014 can learn from Apple is the importance of simple pricing. If you make it easy for people to understand how much they\u2019re paying, and what they\u2019re paying for, it is more likely that they\u2019ll buy it. Or perhaps this is driven more by the converse: if people are confused about how much they have to pay, they\u2019re more likely not to. The decision to purchase and the act of paying are part of the experience for any product or service, and should be designed accordingly. Not paying is always simple. Those companies that succeed with complex pricing schemes tend to be those with no competition (e.g. cable companies and land-line phone services) or those with a limited number of competitors, all of whom offer similarly complex pricing schemes. E.g. new car dealers and cell phone carriers. Car dealers get away with loose, uncertain \u201ctry negotiating down from a \u2018sticker\u2019 price almost no one actually pays\u201d pricing because that\u2019s how all other car dealers work, too \u2014 and because (at least here in the U.S.) a car is something most people need (or at least think they need). Cell phone carriers get away with confusing bills, chock-a-block with nickel-and-dime fees and charges, because there are only a handful of carriers (and as time goes on, we need fewer and fewer fingers to count them all \u2014 again, at least here in the U.S.) and, again, because cell phones are something most people consider a necessity. For non-necessities, simplicity of pricing is key. Apple thrives at this. Their consumer products tend to follow a simple good/better/best pricing hierarchy, where the only difference is storage capacity. iPods, iPads, and iPhones all follow this model. When they deviate from this, the reasons are relatively easy to understand. For example, a regular Wi-Fi iPad costs $499/599/699 for 16/32/64 GB of storage. If you want an iPad with built-in 3G, it costs $130 extra for the iPad itself, and offers a simple no-contract two-tier pricing plan: $15/month for 250 MB data, $25 for 2 GB. Easy to sign up for, easy to cancel, no hidden fees, and several warnings before you hit your data limits. Another great example: Netflix. You pay $8/month for Netflix streaming: For only $7.99 a month, you can instantly watch TV episodes & movies streaming over the Internet to your TV via an Xbox 360, PS3, Wii or any other device that streams from Netflix. Watch as often as you want, anytime you want. Are there really no late fees and no due dates? Yes, it\u2019s true \u2014 there really are no late fees, no due dates, and no hidden costs. Once you sign up for a Netflix account, it works for all Netflix content from any device that supports Netflix. You don\u2019t pay extra to use it on your iPad in addition to your iPhone. You don\u2019t pay more to use it from both a PS3 and an Xbox 360. You pay $8/month (after a free 30-day trial, that is), and you get Netflix streaming. Easy to understand, and sounds like a great value. This brings me to The New York Times\u2019s new digital subscriptions. They\u2019re neither easy-to-understand nor sound like a great value. Unlimited access to the NYT costs four times more than Netflix \u2014 $35 every four weeks. You can pay $15 or $20 every four weeks instead, but then you\u2019ve got to choose between using a Times app on your smartphone or iPad (respectively). And how many normal people realize that if you, say, opt for the $15 plan, that you\u2019ll be able to access the Times website from your iPad? Netflix: one price, access from any device. New York Times: three tiers, arbitrary division between devices based on screen size. Both companies also have legacy businesses. Netflix\u2019s legacy business is home delivery of DVD and Blu-ray discs. Pricing for this service starts at $2/month in addition to the basic $8/month plan. It makes sense: every Netflix customer gets a digital subscription; those that want a physical product too pay a little more. The pricing steers people toward a digital-only future. The New York Times\u2019s legacy business is the printed newspaper. They charge less for a print subscription than an all-inclusive digital subscription, despite the fact that all print subscriptions include an all-inclusive digital subscription. This makes no sense. You pay less but get something that intuitively bears a significant real cost: hundreds of pounds of printed newspaper delivered to your home throughout the year. The pricing steers people toward the legacy business. I want The New York Times to thrive. It\u2019s long been my favorite source for national and world news. But printed newspapers have a limited \u2014 perhaps very limited \u2014 future, and the digital subscription plan they\u2019ve unveiled doesn\u2019t look like a winner to me. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s too expensive \u2014 that is to say, that I think The Times would make more money by charging significantly less, making up for the difference per-subscriber in the number of people who\u2019d be willing to sign up. But even worse, it\u2019s too complex. Further, by offering relatively generous access to the nytimes.com website for free to everyone, the Times is providing an enticement to read the Times less. A digital NYT subscription is something few people will feel they need. Many people might want one, to one degree or another, but for few will it be a necessity. That means it ought to be priced simply. (Even necessities ought to be priced simply on general principle, I say, but they don\u2019t need to be in order to succeed.) I\u2019m almost entirely in agreement with Khoi Vinh on the matter. Vinh writes: The effects of this decision probably won\u2019t be seen in the immediate future, but the long-term damage to the brand may be significant. The amount of notoriety that this new endeavor will receive is sure to be tremendous, but all the subtleties \u2014 and complex mathematics \u2014 of this new pay model are likely to be lost on most news consumers. Its many rules and semantics are simply too complex to be communicated effectively, and what\u2019s more the marketing tends to use blatantly tricky language (e.g., \u201c$15 every four weeks\u201d \u2014 just tell me what I have to pay, already). I\u2019m willing to bet that what most people will understand about this new development is that now you have to pay to read The New York Times. Period. With that misunderstanding, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if users start staying away in droves. Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e attempts to elucidate the entirety of The Times\u2019s new rules for accessing its digital content \u2014 what do you get for free, and what do you get for how much when you pay. It takes him eight paragraphs and 350 words. He concludes that it\u2019s simply too complicated: Customers don\u2019t make decisions with their neocortex, an organ that is too easy to bullshit. They decide within deeper, comforting recesses, and they rationalize when the culture demands a seemingly logical, socially acceptable \u201cpost-plantation\u201d. What price do NYT\u2019s execs put on simplicity, on ease, on reader enjoyment vs. catering to their own internal discourse? If they don\u2019t like talking to Steve Jobs (and vice versa) they could turn to Jeff Bezos for tips on simplicity. iTunes has taught us that customers are willing to pay for content if the process is simple if it\u2019s easy on the mind and the wallet. One could argue that consumers aren\u2019t paying for the content, they\u2019re paying for the delivery service. Regard Netflix on Demand, to use another example. Restricted content, instant delivery, success. I don\u2019t know that a simpler, lower-priced digital subscription plan would work for The Times, but I feel strongly that it would be more likely to work than what they\u2019ve announced. I have a bad feeling about this.\u00a0\u2605 The Evolution of SXSW\u00a0Interactive Friday, 18 March 2011 Andy Budd, on last week\u2019s SXSW Interactive: In reality in think SXSW jumped the shark in 2008/09 and is now an entirely different conference. It\u2019s just taken me a couple of years to reconcile the difference and develop a new set of coping strategies. This year I finally gave up on the conference itself, going to a handful of sessions. I met many more who hadn\u2019t seen a single session and several who didn\u2019t even bother buying a ticket. Instead people spent time seeing friends and maintaining the weak ties in their social graph. I say that somewhat wryly, but SXSW really has become about networking in the most real and genuine sense of the word. I had a great time, once again, but only in the sense that Austin is a fine city and you can\u2019t help but have fun hanging out with good friends from across the country (and globe) whom you see in person only rarely. The conference itself, though, is a mess. As Budd says, you can\u2019t go from a conference of 2,500 attendees to one of 25,000 attendees without turning the event into something entirely different. I first attended SXSW Interactive in 2005 and haven\u2019t missed one since. Each year has been bigger than the previous, and so the conference has always been changing. Once it outgrew the Austin Convention Center, though, it grew into something I no longer enjoyed. I don\u2019t see how anyone could claim that the conference now is anything but broken. A prime example: Despite the fact that there were almost 25,000 attendees, almost no one saw Matt Haughey\u2019s excellent talk in person, because the conference schedulers put Haughey in an obscure location across the river, a mile away from the Austin Convention Center. There were about 30 or 40 people in the room for his talk. Good sessions are scheduled at bad times in obscure locations and banal, unprepared panels are held in cavernous but empty rooms in the ACC. It could well be that SXSW Interactive 2011 was as well-produced as it could have been given 25,000 attendees and the space available in downtown Austin. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to program a cohesive, interesting, accessible session schedule given those constraints. Used to be that SXSW was an interesting conference and a great weekend experience. Now it\u2019s a terrible conference and a good-but-crowded weekend experience. Maybe 25,000 attendees can\u2019t be wrong, and I\u2019m just a curmudgeon yearning for the days of old. There\u2019s no denying that the ACC was packed with people every day. But everyone I know either (a) attended only a handful of sessions; (b) went to sessions but complained bitterly about the quality and regretted the waste of their time; or (c) didn\u2019t even bother getting a conference pass this year. There\u2019s something sad about a conference where it\u2019s now considered the smart move not to even attend. There\u2019s got to be a better way.\u00a0\u2605 Why the Nitro JavaScript Engine Isn\u2019t Available to Apps Outside Mobile Safari in iOS\u00a04.3 Thursday, 17 March 2011 Along a similar line to today\u2019s story about the performance differences between Mobile Safari and the system-wide UIWebView control in iOS 4.3, was Tuesday\u2019s mini-brouhaha about web app performance outside Mobile Safari. The Register, as usual, sensationalized it best, in a story headlined \u201cApple Handcuffs \u2018Open\u2019 Web Apps on iPhone Home Screen\u201d: Apple\u2019s iOS mobile operating system runs web applications at significantly slower speeds when they\u2019re launched from the iPhone or iPad home screen in \u201cfull-screen mode\u201d as opposed to in the Apple Safari browser, and at the same time, the operating system hampers the performance of these apps in other ways, according to tests from multiple developers and The Register. It\u2019s unclear whether these are accidental bugs or issues consciously introduced by Apple. But the end result is that, at least in some ways, the iOS platform makes it harder for web apps to replace native applications distributed through the Apple App Store, where the company takes a 30 per cent cut of all applications sold. Whereas native apps can only run on Apple\u2019s operating system, web apps \u2014 built with standard web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript \u2014 can potentially run on any device. \u201cApple is basically using subtle defects to make web apps appear to be low quality \u2014 even when they claim HTML5 is a fully supported platform,\u201d says one mobile web app developer, who asked that his name not be used. The clear insinuation is that web apps running outside Mobile Safari have been made to run slower, but that\u2019s not true. What happened with iOS 4.3 is that web apps (and JavaScript in general) running inside Mobile Safari have been made significantly faster. The Nitro JavaScript engine is only available within Mobile Safari. Outside Mobile Safari \u2014 whether in App Store apps using the UIWebView control, or in true web apps that have been saved to the home screen \u2014 apps get iOS\u2019s older JavaScript engine. Put another way: nothing is slower regarding web apps or web page rendering in iOS 4.3 compared to 4.2 or earlier. If anything, everything is at least a little bit faster. But: the most significant performance improvements in iOS 4.3, particularly for JavaScript, are exclusive to Mobile Safari. The obvious question: Why? The cynical answer is that Apple seeks to discourage the use of home screen web apps. But if that were the case, why don\u2019t apps from the App Store get Nitro either? Many, many App Store apps use embedded UIWebView controls for displaying web content. The real answer is about security. Perhaps the biggest reason for Nitro\u2019s performance improvements over WebKit\u2019s previous JavaScript engine is the use of a JIT \u2014 \u201cJust-In-Time\u201d compilation. Here\u2019s Wikipedia\u2019s page on JIT. A JIT requires the ability to mark memory pages in RAM as executable, but, iOS, as a security measure, does not allow pages in memory to be marked as executable. This is a significant and serious security policy. Most modern operating systems do allow pages in memory to be marked as executable \u2014 including Mac OS X, Windows, and (I believe) Android1. iOS 4.3 makes an exception to this policy, but the exception is specifically limited to Mobile Safari. It\u2019s a trade-off. Most OSes allow marking memory pages as executable for performance reasons. iOS disallows it for security reasons. If you allow for pages of memory to be escalated from writable to executable (even if you require the page be made permanently read-only first), then you are enabling the execution of unsigned native code. It breaks the chain of trust. Allowing remote code to execute locally turns every locally exploitable security flaw into a remotely exploitable one. Apple, as of iOS 4.3, trusts Mobile Safari enough to allow this. The upside is that Mobile Safari is now significantly faster. The downside is that any security exploits against Mobile Safari now potentially allow worse things to happen than before. Web apps that are saved to the home screen do not run within Mobile Safari. They\u2019re effectively saved as discrete apps \u2014 thin wrappers around the UIWebView control. (That\u2019s why they show up individually in the task bar, just like apps from the App Store.) Home screen apps may well eventually get access to the Nitro JavaScript engine \u2014 Apple simply hasn\u2019t yet done (or perhaps finished?) the security work to allow it. It is not an oversight or a bug, or the result of a single person at Apple wishing to hinder the performance of web apps. One way Apple could make Nitro available system-wide in iOS would be to do something similar to what they\u2019ve done with web content plugins (like Flash Player) on Mac OS X: execute JavaScript in a separate (trusted) process that maps back to the host app. On Snow Leopard, Flash Player no longer executes within Safari; instead it gets its own process. Similarly, Apple could introduce a dedicated Nitro JavaScript process that executes JavaScript for any app, rather than executing within any app. I have no idea whether this is something Apple is considering or working on, I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s one way they could offer JavaScript JIT compilation to apps system-wide without allowing most processes to mark writable pages in memory as executable. [Update: And in fact, this is exactly how the still-in-progress WebKit2 framework is designed.] In short, iOS was designed from the ground up to be more secure than Mac OS X. The price for this trade-off is performance. Note too, that Nitro isn\u2019t new. The WebKit team first announced it (then known as \u201cSquirrelFish Extreme\u201d) back in September 2008. That it took until now to show up at all on iOS is an indication of how complicated these security implications are. That Nitro\u2019s availability on iOS is limited to Mobile Safari today does not imply that it will always be limited to Mobile Safari.\u00a0\u2605 I\u2019m actually not 100 percent sure that this is true for Android, but my understanding is that every app on Android is running in a JIT. That\u2019s how the Dalvik virtual machine works \u2014 and the use of a JIT is the reason why recent versions of Android have performed significantly better than previous ones. I don\u2019t see how they could be using a system-wide JIT if the Android OS disallowed processes from marking pages in memory as executable. But if I\u2019m wrong about this, let me know.\u00a0\u21a9 Shop at Amazon.com and support Daring Fireball Linked List\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Display Preferences Copyright \u00a9 2002\u20132011 John Gruber "}

By Chris Hedges The uprisings in the Middle East, the unrest that is tearing apart nations such as the Ivory Coast, the bubbling discontent in Greece, Ireland and Britain and the labor disputes in states such as Wisconsin and Ohio presage the collapse of globalization. They presage a world where vital resources, including food and water, jobs and security, are becoming scarcer and harder to obtain. They presage growing misery for hundreds of millions of people who find themselves trapped in failed states, suffering escalating violence and crippling poverty. They presage increasingly draconian controls and force\u2014take a look at what is being done to Pfc. Bradley Manning\u2014used to protect the corporate elite who are orchestrating our demise. We must embrace, and embrace rapidly, a radical new ethic of simplicity and rigorous protection of our ecosystem\u2014especially the climate\u2014or we will all be holding on to life by our fingertips. We must rebuild radical socialist movements that demand that the resources of the state and the nation provide for the welfare of all citizens and the heavy hand of state power be employed to prohibit the plunder by the corporate power elite. We must view the corporate capitalists who have seized control of our money, our food, our energy, our education, our press, our health care system and our governance as mortal enemies to be vanquished. Adequate food, clean water and basic security are already beyond the reach of perhaps half the world\u2019s population. Food prices have risen 61 percent globally since December 2008, according to the International Monetary Fund. The price of wheat has exploded, more than doubling in the last eight months to $8.56 a bushel. When half of your income is spent on food, as it is in countries such as Yemen, Egypt, Tunisia and the Ivory Coast, price increases of this magnitude bring with them malnutrition and starvation. Food prices in the United States have risen over the past three months at an annualized rate of 5 percent. There are some 40 million poor in the United States who devote 35 percent of their after-tax incomes to pay for food. As the cost of fossil fuel climbs, as climate change continues to disrupt agricultural production and as populations and unemployment swell, we will find ourselves convulsed in more global and domestic unrest. Food riots and political protests will be inevitable. But it will not necessarily mean more democracy. The refusal by all of our liberal institutions, including the press, universities, labor and the Democratic Party, to challenge the utopian assumptions that the marketplace should determine human behavior permits corporations and investment firms to continue their assault, including speculating on commodities to drive up food prices. It permits coal, oil and natural gas corporations to stymie alternative energy and emit deadly levels of greenhouse gases. It permits agribusinesses to divert corn and soybeans to ethanol production and crush systems of local, sustainable agriculture. It permits the war industry to drain half of all state expenditures, generate trillions in deficits, and profit from conflicts in the Middle East we have no chance of winning. It permits corporations to evade the most basic controls and regulations to cement into place a global neo-feudalism. The last people who should be in charge of our food supply or our social and political life, not to mention the welfare of sick children, are corporate capitalists and Wall Street speculators. But none of this is going to change until we turn our backs on the Democratic Party, denounce the orthodoxies peddled in our universities and in the press by corporate apologists and construct our opposition to the corporate state from the ground up. It will not be easy. It will take time. And it will require us to accept the status of social and political pariahs, especially as the lunatic fringe of our political establishment steadily gains power. The corporate state has nothing to offer the left or the right but fear. It uses fear\u2014fear of secular humanism or fear of Christian fascists\u2014to turn the population into passive accomplices. As long as we remain afraid nothing will change. Friedrich von Hayek and Milton Friedman, two of the major architects for unregulated capitalism, should never have been taken seriously. But the wonders of corporate propaganda and corporate funding turned these fringe figures into revered prophets in our universities, think tanks, the press, legislative bodies, courts and corporate boardrooms. We still endure the cant of their discredited economic theories even as Wall Street sucks the U.S. Treasury dry and engages once again in the speculation that has to date evaporated some $40 trillion in global wealth. We are taught by all systems of information to chant the mantra that the market knows best. Advertisement It does not matter, as writers such as John Ralston Saul have pointed out, that every one of globalism\u2019s\u00a0 promises has turned out to be a lie. It does not matter that economic inequality has gotten worse and that most of the world\u2019s wealth has became concentrated in a few hands. It does not matter that the middle class\u2014the beating heart of any democracy\u2014is disappearing and that the rights and wages of the working class have fallen into precipitous decline as labor regulations, protection of our manufacturing base and labor unions have been demolished. It does not matter that corporations have used the destruction of trade barriers as a mechanism for massive tax evasion, a technique that allows conglomerates such as General Electric to avoid paying any taxes. It does not matter that corporations are exploiting and killing the ecosystem on which the human species depends for life. The steady barrage of illusions disseminated by corporate systems of propaganda, in which words are often replaced with music and images, are impervious to truth. Faith in the marketplace replaces for many faith in an omnipresent God. And those who dissent\u2014from Ralph Nader to Noam Chomsky\u2014are banished as heretics. 1 \u00a0 2 \u00a0 3 \u00a0 NEXT PAGE >>> TAGS: bush capitalism chris hedges clinton collapse democracy economy environment globalization government health health care history middle east money oil politics protest resources security terrorism uprising war water Related Entries March 29, 2011 Obama Addresses His Third Muslim War March 29, 2011 The Sleeping Giants of Tiny Bahrain March 29, 2011 This Friend Was a Fighter March 28, 2011 Take Two Walnuts, Jog and Call Me in the Morning March 28, 2011 Lupe Fiasco Calls Out Obama, Among Others Email to a friend Get truth delivered to your inbox every week.

Report this By entropy2, March 29 at 2:57 pm Link to this comment @OzarkMichael -\u00a0 I, too, scratched my head when I read Hedges, at one point, lauding anarchists and wringing his hands over Chomsky\u2019s exile from the left, then invoking \u201cthe heavy hand of state power\u201d to save us all from the\u2026heavy hand of the corporations. (btw - I didn\u2019t see that the \u201cself-described anarchist\u201d you referred to supported all of Hedges\u2019s solutions.) In any case, in your colorful way, you do well point up the contradictions inherent in the Hedges\u2019s writing. On one hand, he fears and hates the evil that a powerful state does, but cannot imagine anything but the powerful state as the cure to our ills. No wonder he\u2019s despondent.

BTW I prefer to limit the name-calling to either \u2018individual\u2019 or \u2018group\u2019. The \u2018group\u2019 controls making money, so how do we evolve the power of monetization to the \u2018individual\u2019? Simple, individuals carry on them pocket digital scales. Like you said before, advanced technology can help the \u2018individual\u2019 or the \u2018group\u2019.

Report this By Ray Joseph Cormier, March 29 at 2:34 pm Link to this comment Socialism, Communism and other similar viewpoints are not new. They were born out of 1st Century Christianity. And all that believed were together, and had all things common; And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need. Acts 2:44-45 And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common. Acts 4:32 For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Grentile, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if yeou be Christ\u2019s, then you are Abraham\u2019s seed, and heirs according to the promise. Galatians 3:26-29 Now imagine if you were spreading that message as a member of the new sect of Judaism called Christianity. The rich land and slave owners of the Roman Empire would do anything to eradicate that kind of perception taking hold of the population. And so it is to this very Day.

[u can\u2019t have socialism w.o. socialists nor fascism w.o fascists]. building or maintaining fascism, say, in india, u.s. is a piece of cake with their respective pops much or near totally fascist [inegalitarian, supremacistic on personal, cultural, linguistic, national, and cultic levels. in short, socialism is a mere ideology; just very recently applied. and wherever it had been or is applied [tried], is surrounded by supremacist army, navy, airforce, wmd; continuously threatened, demonized, etc. it goes w.o. saying that personal supremacists [me-better-worthier- smarter-than-u] being ferociously addicted to this extreme reality, cannot or will not give up their addiction if we just complain, nag, plead with them. what we need is a governmental party which wld stand antipodally to the party representing these addicts. and give them our toughest love we cld muster. and congress is the place to do it!

Report this By ososotired, March 29 at 1:15 pm Link to this comment Two things which stand out as I watch my situation spiral down along with the rest of America are - 1) The supreme Court of Corporate Interests is about to really show its mettle with two cases - Walmart and the final nail in campaign finance regulation. With these two decisions it will be possible for corporations to evade ANY responsibility for anything they do. If every criminal act done by a corporation must be considered as separate and not able to be considered a class, joined with others, it means no more worry, no more pages of disclaimers and cautions on Drugs, no more worries about any safety concerns (the CPSC will have no clout at all) and no more worries about contracts having to be binding - especially in the Credit Industry. The second thing which I am amazed even the corporate press hasn\u2019t picked up on is that Nuclear Power has NEVER been able to produce electricity at a saving - neither to the pocketbook nor to the economy. The Union of Concerned Scientists has been tracking costs and subsidies of up-and-running plants and finds that they require subsidies (read cash from taxpayers) to operate and to maintain and to store spent fuel. The result is that the electricity produced would be cheaper if instead, the government just bought power from the grid and gave it away. A little more research would have shown that - even excluding the catastrophic costs of a major disaster like 3 mile Island or the Japan Debacle, the cost of electricity and material resources (cement, steel, copper, wood, plastics etc) needed to build a plant and the environmental destruction caused in construction are NEVER recouped! The money in Nuclear is in construction and not operation. This fact was presented in the early 70\u2019s by a British Economist and Sociologist. He pointed out that at the point where a plant could claim it had replaced the power it used for construction, it then would require more construction to store the backlog of spent fuel. This researcher was a very hands on, logical guy who showed that economies of scale were false because they depended on at least one component of the business remaining static as far as cost or availability. He showed that British Brick Production, then in decline, could be saved if the closed small factories were given an amount of cash to reopen which would be less than half the tax breaks for the large companies (pro-rated for size). The cost of fuel for delivery of bricks had risen so high that shipping the finished goods to the corners of Britain was pushing prices higher. He got a grant to test the theory and the little company prospered by limiting its delivery area, using local raw material, and by using PEOPLE instead of very expensive automation. Also the quantities his small company would ship were smaller so the large number of small builders saw savings of up to 25\u00a2 a brick! Naturally this guy was summarily drummed out of his job in University, dropped from several British Societies of academics and I have found it nearly impossible to find him on the net. His efforts were detailed on a TV series \u201cConnections\u201d But beyond that I haven\u2019t found him. Maybe your research could. Love your columns. Report this By Arraya, March 29 at 12:56 pm Link to this comment The world is governed by a philosophy that selling more and more materials i.e. turning things into money increases social well being and health.\u00a0 Around this philosophy we have created a man made \u2018science\u2019, which really is not a science at all, because it uses \u201cThe economic method\u201d which is \u201ccorrelation\u201d (this happened before that happened, and thus assume, that it must have caused it). Correlation is also called \u201cmagical thinking\u201d for the obvious reasons.\u00a0 What this does is set up economists as professional excuse makers and manipulators as well as taking undo credit for success that has nothing to do with economic theories but a highly complex set of circumstances.\u00a0 In other words, it\u2019s all bullshit.\u00a0 Lets back up a bit: Philosophical underpinnings Liberalism: Explaining liberalism to North Americans is a thankless and possibly futile task, but it is one that must be attempted for clarity\u2019s sake. Liberalism is a theory of political economy that arose in Great Britain in the 17th and 18th centuries. Its principal inspirations were Thomas Hobbes (1588- 1679) and John Locke (1632-1704). It emphasizes individualism, human avarice, the \u201cvirtue\u201d of competition and the \u201cjustice\u201d of the marketplace. It opposed feudalism and mercantilism. It sought to replace the traditional landowners with the rising commercial and manufacturing classes. It sought to liberate capital, not people (and especially not women, slaves and propertyless males). The institutionalization of the market system: The French physician Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay (1694-1774) was the leader of a sect of Enlightenment thinkers known as the Physiocrats (or \u00e9conomistes) who founded Libertarian economics. The term \u201cPhysiocracy\u201d means rule of nature and was coined in 1767 by Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours to describe the doctrine of the first modern school of economics. Quesnay transformed economics into its modern role as the science of wealth. In so doing he disengaged economic process from its role as servant of the sociopolitical order, and established its claim to be the direct manifestation of the natural order. In other words, he argued that economic process itself embodied natural law and should thus dictate the sociopolitical order. It just so happens at the time Europe was plagued with increasing peasant revolts and the educated class thought if they get them to act \u201ceconomic\u201d it would quell their \u201cirrational passions\u201d. Libertarian economics were imported to America by Pierre Samuel DuPont, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and James Madison thereby establishing America as the first Libertarian state. The principal functions of America\u2019s new Libertarian government were two: #1. To protect private property. #2. To force men to act economically(which is supposed to be rational). Here\u2019s what classical liberal economist Adam Smith (1723-1790) said: Quote \u201cWhenever there is great property, there is great inequality. For one very rich man, there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the rich supposes the indigence of the many, who are often driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. ... Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all.\u201d This means that, in liberal societies, the rich are pitted against the poor, gaining their wealth by appropriating the work of others; and it means that government is in \u201cbusiness\u201d to protect the ruling class.\u00a0 And market dynamics are the manifestation of \u201cnatural law\u201d(maybe somebody should let physicists know) Over the past century the US has sought to spread the \u201cgood news\u201d of capital accumulation, privatization and consumerism around the world and have succeeded fantastically.

As far as those who say that folks like Chris or Ralph Nader are doomsayers who will never be satisfied, well, that\u2019s just subversive nonsense. I agree with Chris and voted for Nader (much to the consternation of my liberal Dem friends), and I would be quite happy with socialized healthcare, a good pension,adequate employment for all, highly regulated capitalism that includes the progressive tax rates we had in the 1970s\u2026that includes a rational distribution of wealth to sustain a democracy but doesn\u2019t do away with all \u2018wealth\u2019 per se.

Contrary to your view in 1802 Paine indeed gave the omen of the still active evil of Corporatecraft that has consumed us today when recognizing that \u201c...a faction [of Corporatecrafters and Christiancrafers],acting in disguise, was rising in America; they had lost sight of first principles.\u00a0 They were beginning to contemplate government as a profitable monopoly, and the people as hereditary property.\u00a0 It is, therefore, no wonder that the \u2018Rights of Man\u2019 was attacked by that faction, and its author continually abused.\u201d Letter I of Paine\u2019s \u201cEight Letters to the Citizens of the United States and Particularly to the Leaders of the Federal Faction\u201d written in 1802-1803 during the second and third year of the presidency of Thomas Jefferson. Our great president3 campaigned on the principles outlined in Paine\u2019s Rights of Man and on the slogan: \u201cA New Revolution on Principle.\u201d\u00a0 Paine made reference to the kingly presidency of John Adams known as \u201cThe Reign of Terror\u201d limited to four years by the election TJ in 1800.\u00a0 The Federal Faction of Corporatecrafters and Christiancrafters are the political and religious charlatans of the GOP and aided and abetted by most of the Democratic Party.\u00a0 In 1816, Jefferson wrote that virtue and interest are inseparable.\u00a0 It ends, as might have been expected, in the ruin of its people, but this ruin will fall heaviest, as it ought to fall, on that hereditary aristocracy which has for generations been preparing for the catastrophe.\u00a0 I hope we shall take warning from the example and crush in its birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength and bid defiance to the laws of our country.\u2014 Jefferson Letter of November 12, 1816 to George Logan. Just before his death ironically on July 4, 1826 Jefferson wrote this omen:\u00a0 \u201cThey are historical facts which belong to the present, as well as future times. I doubt whether a single fact, known to the world, will carry as clear conviction to it, of the correctness of our knowledge of the treasonable views of the federal party of that day [consisting of Corporatecrafters and Christiancrafters originally led by Alexander Hamilton], as that disclosed by this, the most nefarious and daring attempt to dissever the Union, of which the Hartford convention was a subsequent chapter, and both of those having failed, consolidation becomes the fourth chapter of the next book of their [on-going treasonous] history.\u00a0 But this opens with a vast accession of strength from their younger recruits, who, having nothing in them of the feelings or principles of \u201876, now look to a single and splendid government of an aristocracy, founded on banking institutions, and moneyed incorporations under the guise and cloak of their favored branches of manufactures, commerce and navigation, riding and ruling over the plundered ploughman and beggared yeomanry [the working class and small business owners].\u00a0 This will be to them a next best blessing to the monarch of their first aim, and perhaps the surest stepping stone to it. -\u00a0 Jefferson Letter of December 26, 1825 to William Branch Giles.

Report this By Lafayette, March 29 at 2:42 am Link to this comment AN AWAKENING BD: Paine\u2019s thoughts on a true constitutional Republic bringing prosperity to all communities of the world will do just that if free of corruptible forces. Paine was writing in another time within another historical purview. Under monarchy, there was no parliamentary democracy - which remained pie-in-the-sky not only for Paine but other founding-fathers of this nation. Fast-forward to today: We have a parliamentary democracy and look what we\u2019ve done to it out of sheer stupidity of the masses. We elect dunderheads within an electoral process that needs Mountains of Money to convince us airheads by use of the media to vote for people who do, indeed, sell themselves out to vested interests (in order to get elected). But, this has nothing to do with CH\u2019s references to globalization and plutocrats - an amalgam by the journalist that is blindingly inept. The fault, dear friends is not in the stars but in ourselves. (Or, rather, as WS first put it: \u201cThe fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings.\u201d) So, if we are frustrated and downtrodden by this calamity of a political process that surrounds us, let us look at our plight straight in the face. We, the Sheeple, are at fault. And only We, the Sheeple, can correct the fault by voting into power a political class that is willing to put a stop to the wanton use of Megabucks to sway the ignorant masses. How\u2019s that? By putting up as candidates people who can explain in simple terms this extraordinarily complex world that surrounds us, both within and outside of own precious little town, city, state, country. Who will vote for measures that reduce the exaggerated and alarming Income Unfairness of this nation. Iow, who will tax the piss outta the plutocrats and thus place democratic power where it truly belongs within the body-politic. To do so, however, this nations needs an awakening it has never heretofore ever seen. BigBusiness needs a comeuppance to be shown its proper place - not as masters or our Economic Universe but as just another neutral element in a market economy. It should serve that economy and not the particular interests of wealth accumulation purely for the sake of wealth accumulation.

Hayek never used the term \u201cdemocracy\u201d in connection with the market.\u00a0 You do an injustice to Hayek, portraying him as an arch-capitalist ogre. Actually Hayek never proposed abolishing the welfare state \u2013 he was in favor of unemployment benefits, Social Security,\u00a0 the works, although he never went into details. Hayek was perfectly right to denounce (in The Road to Serfdom, 1944) and oppose the overwhelming wave of statism that had gripped the world by the 1940s, egged on by ideological currents like Marxism and Fascism and enabled by the immense centralization of government power in the belligerent countries during the second World War. I admit that Hayek\u2019s reasoning is fairly ludicrous. Almost every statement of fact contained in The Road to Serfdom is inaccurate. However, although his arguments suck, his message is valid: there should be restrictions on state power in the economy, and elsewhere. Above all, Hayek\u2019s doctrine of unshackling the market from bureaucratic and arbitrary restrictions is as valid today as it was then. However, please note that my endorsement of Hayek\u2019s views is hedged in with conditions: economic science has long recognized that countless circumstances can conspire to trigger market failure, which is when the market fails to offer proper incentives for private firms to turn in a good performance. And in cases of market failure, government intervention is usually necessary. The markets that offer the best prospect of satisfying human wants are competitive ones. Only when there is competition, easy access to information about the goods on the market, etc.,\u00a0 does the market trick work. This caveat is systematically ignored by Repugnicans and other moral degenerates. If a market is dominated by a monopoly,\u00a0 it\u2019s usually best for the government to nationalize it. If government bureaucracy is honest and efficient and loyal \u2013 as it is in most advanced countries\u2014 it does an excellent job of running companies. For example, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s privatization in the 1980s of British utilities like gas and water \u2013 which by their nature are monopolistic \u2013 did nothing to improve efficiency and instead fostered a culture of greed and selfishness, while increasing the inequality of income distribution.\u00a0 I think it is extremely important to stress the difference between just plain \u201cmarket\u201d, which offers no guarantee of anything, and \u201ccompetitive market\u201d, which in principle can create the conditions for improvement in a nation\u2019s wealth as well as equality. The sleazy corporate crowd, of course, does its best to confuse the issue. In any case the market should never encompass more than half of a country\u2019s economy \u2013 for the simple reason that countless goods and services are not amenable to market rules and must perforce be provided by non-profits, NGOs and government.

Government was formed haphazardly, a tribe member saying the fire pit should be located in a specific place, or that the hunt should start at dawn. Since then people used government to accomplish goals sometimes shared with the governed, but mostly not so shared. We do not see design for a government implemented until the US Constitution was written although we see Government power regulated far earlier. There have been no designs for government implemented since the 18th century. In most places talking about government design will break the law. There has been a great deal of criticism of government and how it accomplishes goals and what those goals are, but alas, few meaningful designs. The design implemented by the US Constitution carefully tried to prevent one source of power dictating the controls and movement of a particular policy. The implementation completed failed at the dawn of the Civil War and has been crippled since then, although it has been hardy enough to survive, and give us universal suffrage, civil rights, and social security, but it also gave us prohibition, McCarthyism, and the Vietnam War. The design failed because its approach was to divide power into three autonomous sectors, instead of carefully designing the functions of government and limiting its powers to just those functions. Of course, if it would not have been possible to do so at the time the Constitution was written, because of the malignant presence of legal slavery, but the compromise we received is still a remarkable first step at the implementation of government design. The government should provide its populace the following services: \u2022\u00a0 Housing \u2022\u00a0 Food \u2022\u00a0 Medical Services \u2022\u00a0 Education \u2022\u00a0 Law enforcement and judicial infrastructure \u2022\u00a0 Transportation infrastructure \u2022\u00a0 Diplomatic and military response mechanisms Criminal laws can only be enacted to remedy assaults and thefts. Government funds will come only from sales taxes.\u00a0 No one would be required to accept government services if they do not want them. All the functions need to be carefully defined to prevent misuse.

Coincidentally here is a short review just posted on a blog: http://www.commonwealmagazine.org/blog/?p=12690 (was a first hit when I ggl\u2019d for a reference to post here).

Primarily because all such people are never happy. Never before in history has a society had to give up the items it discovered that enhance the quality of people\u2019s lives. A few people have always controlled most of the wealth. But so what? Wealth is not essential for a quality life. I have a life filled with quality, and none of it was prevented because a few people control most of the wealth. And there is a degree of trickle down economics, because any country that you now visit, in which you can meet an informed long term resident, will tell you that the majority of residents of that country are far better off now than 50 years ago. That is certainly true of Jamaica in the West Indies, where I grew up. A few people own most of the wealth in all societies, because to be quite wealthy you have to be consumed with wealth accumulation; which always produces a predominate internally miserable, never ever satisfied person. And most people are unwilling to deprive themselves of most of life\u2019s valuable pleasures to be overwhelming concerned with making another million next week. It is obvious that our current economic structure, that depends so heavily on non-renewable resources, will come to an end at some time in the near future. But I insist that before then, one or more humans will invent renewable sources of energy and product ingredients, that will enable all of us to continue to live great lives. Let us apply our energies to find and develop those sources, instead of spending our energies sitting at desks writing about how horrible things are now. To be incorporated, you have to become very greedy and have an major aversion to being responsible. Which is why all jobs in corporations are unfulfilling. At some point the in the future corporations will disappear.

Paine always spoke for humankind and influenced revolutionary-minded from all walks of life.\u00a0 Paine\u2019s thoughts on a true constitutional Republic bringing prosperity to all communities of the world will do just that if free of corruptible forces.\u00a0 Consequently, all true patriots\u2014- American New Guards rising today\u2014-\u00a0 must take advantage of the spirit of the moment fermenting not only in our country but all over the world.\u00a0 See \u201cnew Guards\u201d under Declaration of Independence. The time is right to unite under a political banner [ANG or The People Party] that would lead to the working class and small business owners finally voting in their collective interests to be free of the Corporatecrafter monopolistic empire of fixed enterprise.\u00a0 The Corporatecrafters and their hireling/lacky politicians, all of imagined nobility, have corrupted our constitutional government to the egalitarian and economic injury of The People in mockery of our Constitution.\u00a0 Thus, \u201cWe The People, of the United States,[as the natural majority and voting class must unite as such] in Order to form a more perfect Union,establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity,\u201d must restore our Constitution as our Moral Compass and Authority under our constitutional Republic and completely dismantle the usurped Corporate monopoly/cartel of organized crime sponsored on Taxpayer funds. The greedy wealthy of imagined nobility must be excluded from holding position of power via elections.\u00a0 All positions of power must be filled via elections and trusted to the best and talented of The People.\u00a0 Although proven to be afflicted with the delusion of imagined nobility Alexander Hamilton supported this position in Federalist Paper 84:\u00a0 \u201cNothing need be said to illustrate he importance of the prohibition of titles of nobility [including the imagined nobility afflicted with the delusion of entitlement to plunder our Treasury and resources].\u00a0 This may truly be denominated the corner stone of republican government; for so long as they are excluded, there can never be serious danger that the government will be any other than that of the people.\u201d Report this By Gary Mont, March 28 at 8:45 pm Link to this comment WriterOnTheStorm: re Neoliberalism\u2026 How is this any different than fascism.

In this case it\u2019s not globalization, but Neoliberalism. Globalization\u2014the elimination of international trade barriers to allow corporations to manufacture in the cheapest economies and sell in the most expensive ones\u2014is only one element of neoliberalism. And it may be one of the least offensive aspects of neoliberalism since one can make effective arguments that it brings economic opportunity to those in the cheaper economies, as it is doing in China, India and South Korea. Other, more sinister features of neoliberalism include market deregulation (the \u2018liberal\u2019 part of neoliberalism refers to the market), disempowering labor (that\u2019s right, union busting), and monetarist policy (a central bank controlling inflation), but the defining feature of neoliberalism, the mark of the beast, is the notion that the market knows best. Hayek\u2019s \u201cepiphany\u201d was the idea that the market is the most direct expression of democracy, giving the citizen cum consumer the ability to vote every day with their pocketbook. The market, in turn, can be far more responsive to the citizen/consumer\u2019s needs than government ever could be, since government is bogged down by the pesky problems of corruption, inefficiency, ineptitude, and that niggling annoyance of having to serve some \u201cabstract\u201d concept of the long term public interest. Both Hayek and Friedman advanced the theory that there literally is no such thing as the public interest. Society is simply too disparate. It was a seductive idea, not just because knowing what is truly in the public interest requires more wisdom than most politicos can muster, but also because abdicating responsibility for the public interest to the market makes government\u2019s job a whole lot easier. If there is no public interest to serve, the theory goes, then government should simply step aside and let individual expression shape society\u2014and America is nothing if not the world\u2019s champion of maverick individualism, right? The resulting symbiosis of neoliberalism and American Exceptionalism has meant that every president since Reagan, including Obama, became an unquestioning acolyte of neoliberal gospel. Clinton mistakenly ascribed the boom years of the \u201890\u2019s to neoliberal economic policy, when in truth it was the result of the dot.com bubble. Obama appears to be drawing the same wrong conclusions. Neoliberalism is dead, long live neoliberalism\u2026 If you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t buy it. What could be more egalitarian? Right? Except that, just like with our politics, we are given only false choices. The market, just like our politics, has been rigged. You are told what to want. Status anxiety is universal and permanent, like the bile necessary for consumption. Advertising is the business of manufacturing that anxiety. That nagging sense of discontent many of us feel is no accident. Soon enough, an iPhone 5 is going to make your iPhone 4 seem inadequate, and that iPhone 3 is strictly loserville. The way you set yourself apart in a consumer society is with your consumer choices. Individuality has been focus-grouped to an inch of its life. Turns out we are not so different after all, and the market is able to satisfy our \u201cindividuality\u201d with just a few limited choices. Your swooshtika is red, everyone else\u2019s is blue. Your car is prohibitively expensive to 99% of the population, therefor it is more individualistic. Its all relative. Its all traffic. What neoliberalism has exposed is that individuality is an even more abstract concept than the public good. Tune in, turn on, and drop out, was the battle cry of the last great social revolution. These days you don\u2019t have to go to all that trouble. Just keep using your iPhone 3. That, and taking your picket sign from Wisconsin to Wall Street couldn\u2019t hurt.

It\u2019s his last work, written while he was in his nineties, not long before he died. In it, he explains how we, as a society, have come to use the term \u201cmarket economy\u201d in place of the term \u201ccapitalism.\u201d The new term is a kinder and gentler one, with its implication that economic power lies with consumers rather than with the owners of capital or with the managers who have taken over the work of the owners. It\u2019s a fine example, says Galbraith, of innocent fraud. An innocent fraud is a lie, but it\u2019s a lie that\u2019s more white than black. It\u2019s a lie that makes most everyone happy.

Such simple questions.\u201d \u2014- Sadly, that is not even a possibility today. Technology is doled out to the public according to only two criteria: Can it increase corporate profits and does it in any way enable the public. The first criteria must be positive and the second negative. If either criteria fails, the technology will be shelved, buried, or sold for military/mercenary, or corporate/government security use only. The public is no longer in the loop as far as technology and science is concerned - it was deemed decades ago by the fascists that such knowledge in public hands was dangerous and undesirable and was thus confined to commercial and miltary possession only. Any technology produced outside of commercial and government control, that enables the public in such a way that threatens the control the powers that be wield over the public, will be found \u201cdangerous, faulty, or fake.\u201d by official authourity and banned.

Report this By Robert Roth, March 28 at 8:03 pm Link to this comment (Unregistered commenter) I agree that working through the Democratic Party, as such, is at this point futile.\u00a0 But I want to suggest that a broader range of techniques than you seem to advocate may yet prove useful, and by mentioning some of the organizations engaged in them. For one, Progressive Democrats of America, a small but feisty organization, is working both in and outside the Democratic Party to achieve precisely the sort of changes we need, primarily by informational campaigns and organizing. You might check out their website before dismissing that thought.\u00a0 They have posted a number of your pieces. As I think Wendell Berry said recently, and as you outline in considerable details, everything of value is threatened, and it seems unlikely the lives we now lead can be sustained in any easily recognizable form. There appears to be, as you\u2019ve said before, just a thin line of defense between civil society and its disintegration. But as Noam Chomsky frequently points out, we do still have enormous freedom to agitate, organize, protest and struggle for change. The ballot box isn\u2019t useless, it just isn\u2019t being used nearly enough. But we still have it. And for its use to be more effective, we need a great many more people who recognize our real problems and demand that our political structures and players address them. It is not yet demonstrably too late to organize a sufficient and sustained opposition to the evils of our time, and a multitude of forces for the common good. That is, by the way, what is so evil about the current attacks on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the safety net generally, such as it still is: The real animus behind these attacks is hostility to the idea of the common good, the notion that we should care about and for one another, the very idea that we have interests in common that we can and should address collectively, through government as well as other forms of social organization. What I think we need is organizing: the development of common understandings and relationships of trust that will enable enough of us to act collectively, constructively, in coordination, to redeem the commons and serve the common good. Given that the airwaves are saturated with lies, the truth needs to be shared through other means: mind-to-mind, hand-to-hand, person-to-person, sometimes but not necessarily face-to-face and one-on-one. That\u2019s what organizing ultimately is, and it can be accomplished in a variety of ways, including by the written as well as the spoken word. Whether this can save the situation in time remains to be seen.\u00a0 But in my view, even the sort of actions you advocate are useful primarily as means of reaching more people and helping to alert, inform, and organize them. In short, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hopeless \u2013 it may be, but that\u2019s just a hypothesis, like its opposite, at this point in our time \u2013 and there are things we can do to affect the outcome. Some of them may consist of protests like the one you, Dan Ellsberg and others recently conducted, and the War Resisters League and the Catholic Workers, to mention just two of my favorites, have routinely engaged in over the years. But others include conversation, speech-making, publication \u2013 writing such as yours \u2013 and even use of the ballot, once organizing has produced a critical mass sufficient to put good people into office. Iraq Veterans Against the War is organizing by a variety of means, and as I wrote to them recently, theirs is some of the best organizing and most important work I\u2019m aware of. Progressive Democrats of America and others are organizing to make more effective use of the ballot box. Even in Congress, there are some very good people: most members of the Progressive Caucus were reelected earlier this month, and Rep. Jan Schakowsky somehow got onto the Deficit Commission and has offered a compassionate and practical alternative to the deficit hawks\u2019 attack on the safety net and the common good.

Paradoxically globalization, rather than stemming from a respect for universal human and/or spiritual principles foments from parochial xenophobic minds. The visceral stupidity of nationalism, the dumb identification with a piece of land and/or skin color underlies a sense of entitlement to feed and grow fat on anything not-self like a parasitic virus. Everything including human life is commodified. The unifying, globalizing principle, therefore is monetary value and only monetary value. The bottom line is the bottom line. So is Greed unleashed, itself like a force of anti-nature to devour the planet. I get it. Too bad many of the poster don\u2019t. . For example, most of the major states of history owed their existence to conquest. The conquering peoples established themselves, legally and economically, as the privileged class of the conquered country. They seized for themselves a monopoly of the land ownership and appointed a priesthood from among their own ranks. The priests, in control of education, made the class division of society into a permanent institution and created a system of values by which the people were thenceforth, to a large extent unconsciously, guided in their social behavior. But historic tradition is, so to speak, of yesterday; nowhere have we really overcome what Thorstein Veblen called \u201cthe predatory phase\u201d of human development. The observable economic facts belong to that phase and even such laws as we can derive from them are not applicable to other phases. Since the real purpose of socialism is precisely to overcome and advance beyond the predatory phase of human development, economic science in its present state can throw little light on the socialist society of the future. Second, socialism is directed towards a social-ethical end. Science, however, cannot create ends and, even less, instill them in human beings; science, at most, can supply the means by which to attain certain ends. But the ends themselves are conceived by personalities with lofty ethical ideals and\u2014if these ends are not stillborn, but vital and vigorous\u2014are adopted and carried forward by those many human beings who, half unconsciously, determine the slow evolution of society.

Do people actually read anymore?Heges never said that the human species is fully incapable of progress.What he correctly stated was that progress is not inevitable that anyone who believes this simply because they live in a world with technologies which are the product of literally thousands of years of inherited knowledge are sadly mistaken. Indeed it was physicist Stephen Hawking who back in \u201898 stated that there has been no significant change in human DNA in over 10,000 years! As for racial tolerance as a sign of human progress\u2014that\u2019s hilarious\u2014considering that \u2018primitive\u2019 societies as well as human civilization in general up until the 17th cen.,possessed no systems of racial categorization.And even when things like racial & sexual tolerance were achieved it wasn\u2019t because people just sat by & allowed \u2018progress\u2019 to take its course\u2014ending slavery & institutional bigotry in the US required bloodshed. Indeed to belive that progress is inevitable is to effectively believe that who\u2019s leading a nation doesn\u2019t matter,economic policy doesn\u2019t,the quality of education in a society doesn\u2019t matter,levels of social bigotry doesn\u2019t matter,scientific inquiry doesn\u2019t matter & ultimatly radical political engagement doesn\u2019t matter because our Hegelian & subsequently Marxist notion of a linear history that leads to a utopian actualization of the species will take care of all our problems.

He sees and says what needs to be seen and said. In the end the only way that things can truly change is reflected by the inner orientation within each soul on our planet. One type of soul, now in the vastly overwhelming majority, is the type who is inwardly defined by the psychology of self interest and exclusion. It is this specific psychology that then becomes the causative basis of all that Chris is documenting in terms of how our countries are defined: economically and politically. The other type of soul is inwardly defined by the psychology of \u2018giving, sharing, and inclusion\u2019. It is this type of person who, when multiplied to make them the majority of the people on our planet, then can create the types of countries, their politics and their economies, that become self sustaining for the common good of all of the citizens. Without this type being in the majority our planet is doomed to extinction.

What I cannot forgive is his only \u201csolution\u201d is a failed, repeatedly failed catastrophic alternative: \u201cWe must rebuild radical socialist movements that demand that the resources of the state and the nation provide for the welfare of all citizens and the heavy hand of state power be employed to prohibit the plunder by the corporate power elite. \u201c These \u201csocialist movements\u201d destroyed the economies of the nations they ran far faster than capitalism has, but they never admit it was due to their own failed philosophy. No, instead it was \u2018sabotaged\u2019 by corporations. Damn right!\u00a0 And if the radical socialist movements had been any damn good, all the attempts at \u2018sabotage\u2019 would have been like a little bird on a hippo\u2019s back.\u00a0 So even the complaint of sabotage reveals the fundamental weakness of socialism.

Report this By Alan MacDonald, March 28 at 1:46 pm Link to this comment I was quite disappointed in Chris\u2019s column this week\u2014- it was weak in language, weak in logic, and weak in revolution. Although his column more than amply details all the \u2018symptom problems\u2019; wars, economic oppression, domestic tyranny, etc., there is no effective nor revolution inspiring focus on the causal cancer which is actually hiding behind a facade and creating all these global \u2018symptom problems\u2019 or \u2018identity issues\u2019. Hedges drags out the old characterization of \u2018globalism\u2019 and \u2018oligarchy\u2019 as the only things to hang his hat on\u2014- and the only things for people to hang for if they listen to his misdirected call for revolution. It amazes me that Hedges, after his perfect diagnosis of the real causal cancer deceptively hiding behind all problems in \u201cEmpire of Illusion\u201d, did not make the clear and obvious point that his confusing language of \u201cglobalism\u201d, \u201cglobalization\u201d, and \u201coligarchy\u201d are nothing but the polite and non-threatening terms that the illusionists of corporate capitalism use to avoid the masses from understanding, and effectively revolting \u201cAgainst Empire\u201d.\u00a0 That the numbing term \u201cglobalism\u201d is nothing but a disguise and dis-empowering illusion for \u201cglobal EMPIRE\u201d. My God, Chris, if you want to empower, rather than dis-empower, people to revolt against a clear and deadly present danger, why not arm people with the seminal truth that that universal, seminal, single, and global cancerous present danger is global Empire?? Calling out global corporate/financial/militarist EMPIRE as the signal evil to be revolted against is the essential starting point to any responsible and serious call for any revolution for liberty and democracy \u201cAgainst Empire\u201d\u2014- anything less smacks of aiding the very \u201cEmpire of Illusion\u201d that Chris himself so clearly, previously, and compellingly identified as the heart of all our problems. Surely Hedges must understand that the masses, the working/middle-classes here and around the world, the very \u201cMultitude\u201d, will not be empowered by calling for a global revolt against the vague and confusing concepts of \u2018globalism\u2019, \u2018globalization\u2019 and \u2018oligarchy\u2019\u2014\u2014since these terms are either mis-understood, vague, or worse\u2014- actually used by the corporate/financial illusionists (like Friedman) themselves to hide the real Empire itself to make \u201cglobalism\u201d sound beneficial, forward-leaning, and exciting. Any serious student of cognitive science and language persuasion, like George Lakoff (who Hedges loves) and Frank Luntz (who Hedges hates), should know that you don\u2019t accept and try to re-use the Empire\u2019s own code word against the hidden Empire, particularly without even shouting out that Empire is the enemy\u2014- but rather that a successful people\u2019s revolution must de-power the propaganda language that the Empire invested, and has been successfully using for more than ten years to hide EMPIRE under a more vague and polite sounding word of their Empire\u2019s own invention. And particularly when the American public, unlike Michele Bachmann, already KNOWS that the first American Revolution was \u201cAgainst EMPIRE\u201d, and that all Americans have an innate distrust, dislike, and built-in hatred of EMPIRE. Chris need sot get a grip and use both the natural, logical, understandable, and EFFECTIVE language of revolution \u201cAgainst EMPIRE\u201d\u2014- doing anything less is just accidentally \u2018feeding word confusion\u2019 or unintentionally aiding the very \u201cEmpire of Illusion\u201d with more illusions.

A simple offer of a 5% cut of all business activities is more than adequate to make those in charge fabulously wealthy. All they need do is inhibit local competition and deny any collective bargaining rights to the populace. Corporations acording to SCOTUS are persons whose obligations are not to any nation but to its ownership. Since coprorations usually have the resources to bribe legislators they need not worry that they will be encumbered by the need to behave in a responsible manner towards the citizens of any country in which they operate. Such activities left Mubarak of Egypt with a fortune of several billions and most national leaders like him have amassed massive piles of assets since they were paid part of the income that normally would be taxes paid into the public coffers to enhance life in the country that supplied the labor and materials which are the genesis of the wealth.

Report this By ardee, March 28 at 11:56 am Link to this comment Hedges has a knack for emotional but realistic rendering of the truth of things. I usually agree with most of what he writes, as I do here. However there is one point I would address as differing from Mr. Hedges eloquent opinion He posits, and I disagree, that the current spate of revolutionary actions in certain nations is a signal of the coming death of globalisation. I think that said uprisings do not guarantee whatsoever that the fascism infecting our governing institutions will end. People rise up to end starvation, to end lives of tragedy and poverty, to address such basic unfairness as has become intolerable. Yet we do not know what government will replace the ones overthrown, if indeed they even are in the end. Governments are not administered by angels, as Alexander Hamilton noted, and those who replace dictators may themselves be turned by money and power. Just as important we must understand these dictators are aided, installed in many cases, and abetted by the Western nations, and especially by US corporations in order to provide safe havens for our corporate business interests. The ruler of Yemen, a perfect example, allows black ops CIA operations in his nation, operations that assassinate at will, and then he takes the credit for such deaths. Is it any wonder we bomb Libya and ignore Yemen? This must end. We the people must not be lulled to sleep by access to cheap plastic toys, enslaved by credit, or live is such fear of our jobs and homes that we refuse our responsibilities to the world and abet, if only by our silence, the installation of dictators for stable business climates. Instead of meddling abroad Americans must look to clean up our own messes,.

Report this By Everest Mokaeff, March 28 at 11:16 am Link to this comment We used to talk about battling greedy corporations.It\u2019s like a new gossip in the town. For many of us it is but a strong metaphor - an idea worth living for or fighting against, depends whose side you\u2019re on. I see every day devastating consequences of brainwashing, reckless consumerism and ignorance. On my own I can do nothing about it. A lot of persons whom I consider very close to me, are obsessed with celebrities gossips and newest ipods - all that crap pouring on us from commercials. My dear friends are integral part of the system we are so eager to destroy. They are sentinels. It doesn\u2019t matter how hard I try to show my girlfriend a different side of the coin, she stubbornly dreams of palaces, parties and all that stuff capitalist institution propagandists want us to fantasize about. There is no way I\u2019m able to unplug her from the matrix, because we\u2019re exposed to it 24/7 thru various channels of manipulation, predominantly television. It\u2019s everywhere. What in practical terms can we do? It took me a while to understand things governments and corporations alike do not want me to know. To get there, I first cut off myself from brainwashing machine, namely television. I watched it but this was my choice and I stirred clear of all known outlets of corporate lies and state propaganda. Then I started listen to different kind of people. I started reading different kind of papers and books. All of a sudden, I started thinking and speaking for myself. I started doing things on my own. And I started taking responsibility for everything I\u2019ve done ever since. Secondly, I stay away from all sorts of traps laid down for stupid consumer to get him trapped in monetary vassalage. It\u2019s not easy to consciously reject material wealth in society that is based upon it. The first blow to the system is to break free. If you\u2019re as interested in dismantling the system as many of you claim here, it\u2019s time to get your freedom back. Beware, the moment you get self-conscious, the system imminent response will be full-blown retaliation.

SquirrelMail was spotted in use by Mark Zuckerberg's and Sean Parker's characters. So far, no one has contacted us regarding our cut of the box office. ;-) NEWS: Is SquirrelMail \"Notable?\" Jul 23, 2010 by Paul Lesniewski \u00a0 It seems that one Wikipedia user thinks that SquirrelMail is not considered \"notable\" enough to retain its own Wikipedia page. Do you agree? Disagree? Voice your opinion. UPDATE: As of November 2010, SquirrelMail's notability seems to have been commonly agreed upon and the notability warning has been removed. Thanks to everyone who contributed to the discussion and especially those who took it upon themselves to improve the article itself! ANNOUNCE: SquirrelMail 1.4.21 Released Jul 23, 2010 by Paul Lesniewski \u00a0 The SquirrelMail Team is pleased to announce the release of SquirrelMail version 1.4.21. This is primarily a maintenance release which addresses a smattering of small issues and adds some fine-tuning of recent changes. It also closes two relatively low-risk security issues. Before this release, for environments with highly active users, the number of security tokens could have bloated user session (and preference) files to an unacceptable size, hurting overall responsiveness. This release scales back the default validity period of security tokens from 30 days to two days, which should fix this problem in most cases. The administrator is always free to change this value by specifying $max_token_age_days in config/config_local.php. There are also fixes for minor issues related to header folding, faster and more resilient display of encoded subjects, quoting of encoded addresses upon reply, provision of a subject when using forward-as-attachment, and a few other tidbits. This release also includes fixes for two low-risk vulnerabilities. The first, CVE-2010-1637, allows authenticated users to use the Mail Fetch plugin as a network/port/DNS scanner. The second, CVE-2010-2813, poses a denial-of-service risk when passwords containing 8-bit characters are used to log in. While we characterize these issues as fairly low risk, it is nevertheless recommended that users of previous versions of SquirrelMail upgrade at their earliest convenience. For more complete details, see the ReleaseNotes and ChangeLog files included in this release (in the doc/ directory). NEWS: imapproxy project adopted by SquirrelMail May 05, 2010 by Paul Lesniewski \u00a0 Many SquirrelMail administrators will be familiar with imapproxy, the wonderful and very stable IMAP proxy software developed by Dave McMurtrie. Those who are not should look into it, as it provides a significant performance boost to stateless webmail applications (see http://imapproxy.org). Dave has decided that it is time to retire from his role with the software and has asked us to take it on. We are excited to accept his offer and look forward to keeping the project relevant and stable. We are already hosting imapproxy.org and in the future we'll be merging that into this website as well as adding Dave's code to our SVN repository, etc. Thanks again, Dave! We wish you well in your next endeavors! NEWS: G/PGP Plugin Revived Mar 21, 2010 by Paul Lesniewski \u00a0 The G/PGP Encryption Plugin plugin is a crucial add-on for many SquirrelMail installations, so we were sorry to see it fall into disrepair in the recent past. However, we've now revived it and a new, working version is in testing. If you'd like to help test, ask on the squirrelmail-plugins mailing list or ask Paul directly. ANNOUNCE: SquirrelMail 1.4.20 Released Mar 07, 2010 by Paul Lesniewski \u00a0 The SquirrelMail Team is pleased to announce the release of SquirrelMail version 1.4.20. This release makes final the changes implemented in our last two release candidates and adds several smaller fixes and feature improvements. Of those new fixes and improvements not included in our last release candidate, the most notable fix is that for the formerly broken search page, but we've also fixed sorting in the Sent folder, handling of complex mailto: addresses, display of multibyte subjects, quoting of encoded headers, automatic installation address detection (especially useful for lighttpd environments), a privacy issue related to DNS prefetching of email content, and added unread links in the message view and a Gmail IMAP configuration option. For more complete details, see the ReleaseNotes and ChangeLog files included in this release (in the doc/ directory). Due to the security fixes included in our last two release candidate packages, we advise all users of SquirrelMail versions 1.4.19 and below to upgrade.

Benjamin Alijagi\u0107 Great video! Please more testing tutorials! http://www.obliviousinvestor.com/ Mike P Thanks for this video! I\u2019ve been trying to figure out how to do this for some time. Additional question: What if my goal is getting them to click an outbound link? (I\u2019m an author marketing my books on Amazon.) Since I can\u2019t put tracking code on an Amazon page, would it work to make a page on my site that just redirects to the Amazon page, but also includes the optimizer javascript? Something like: mysite.com/book.html (and the file would consist of the optimizer javascript, followed by the redirect javascript)? http://carsonified.com Ryan Carson That should work fine, however, I\u2019ve never done it. Also, you can connect Google Analytics with Google Website Optimizer, so you can create Goals and measure those. You\u2019d need to get Amazon to send buyers back to a thankyou page on your site though, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s possible. http://www.obliviousinvestor.com/ Mike P Cool. Thanks for the reply\u2013I\u2019ll give it a go tonight. :) (As to getting Amazon to send people back to my site, I can\u2019t imagine how I\u2019d do that.

Thanks for the video\u2026 you make it look so simple. And once trying it once or twice, it really is simple. I was wondering if it\u2019s possible to do a test on a page that has multiple conversion goals. Like a page with product a, b, and c? jared GREAT tutorial!! Thanks. I\u2019m having trouble getting this to work for a home page with an Aweber opt-in form. I\u2019m basically enclosing the entire page in the control script and loading variations of video, text, and an aweber form. For some reason the forms are showing up in IE. When I preview them they work fine but once live the forms don\u2019t show up at all. I realize this is a pretty vague problem and a long shot anyone has had this some issue, but just thought I\u2019d see if anyone had and has a suggestion. I\u2019m basically just wanting to test various video/text/image combinations on a wordpress home page to test conversions and figured this would work. http://www.claususonline.com Jorge R. Hi there Ryan, Great tutorial. I had tried before to do A/B testing in WordPress, but never succeeded at it. I guess it was because I didn\u2019t consider multivariate testing the way you show it on your tutorial. I\u2019m no techie, so I guess I better start testing simple things and then move on from there. Like using aweber forms and stuff like that. Thnx for the light!! http://www.itsdigitalmarketing.co.uk/ Gary Robinson Bit late to the party on this article, but thank you very much for the useful video. I\u2019m just starting on A/B testing and was looking for ideas on how to test on a WordPress blog. Your video answered that perfectly.

One question: is it also possible to do this with images or widgets? http://www.jamiemchale.co.uk jamiemchale Just a quick tip: In the video you disabled the visual editor. You can use WordPress shortcodes to insert the section into your blog post using the visual editor. Just add a couple of lines to your functions.php in your theme: add_shortcode( \u2018gwo\u2019, \u2018gwo_shortcode\u2019 ); function gwo_shortcode( $atts, $content = null ) { $t = \u201cutmx_section(\u201c\u201d .esc_attr($atts[section]) .\u201d\")\u201d .$content .\u201d\"; return $t; } http://carsonified.com Ryan Carson Great tip!

Placeholder attribute allows you to display text in a form input when it is empty and when it is not focused (it clears the field on focus). This is a nifty feature, but it is not supported by all browsers yet. This tutorial will show you how to use Modernizr to detect if placeholder is supported, or else use jQuery to display the fallback placeholder text dynamically. Demo HTML5 Placeholder Download Demo Zip Old School Javascript Way Before we had the placeholder attribute, we relied on Javascript to fake the placeholder text. Below is an example. The text is inserted in the value attribute. On focus, it checks if the value is \"search\" and returns empty to clear the field. If the value is empty, it returns \"search.\" As you can see, this way is not an efficient way because each field has to be checked. <input type=\"text\" value=\"Search\" onfocus=\"if (this.value == 'Search') {this.value = '';}\" onblur=\"if (this.value == '') {this.value = 'Search';}\"> jQuery Placeholder Text (Demo) Now with HTML5 placeholder, it is more semantic to use placeholder than value attribute. However, placeholder text is not supported by all browsers. To make it cross-browser, Modernizr and jQuery come in handy here. Modernizr is used here to check if placeholder is supported. If placeholder is not supported, the jQuery code will run. It finds all elements with placeholder attribute and stores in a variable. It then compares the input value with the placeholder attribute. If the input value is empty, it will display the placeholder text and add a \"placeholder\" class to the input field. View Demo. To use this on your site, download a copy of Modernizr and jQuery and paste the following code any where in your html page (be sure the jquery.js and modernizr.js file is in correct path). <script src=\"jquery.js\"></script> <script src=\"modernizr.js\"></script> $(document).ready(function(){ if(!Modernizr.input.placeholder){ $('[placeholder]').focus(function() { var input = $(this); if (input.val() == input.attr('placeholder')) { input.val(''); input.removeClass('placeholder'); } }).blur(function() { var input = $(this); if (input.val() == '' || input.val() == input.attr('placeholder')) { input.addClass('placeholder'); input.val(input.attr('placeholder')); } }).blur(); $('[placeholder]').parents('form').submit(function() { $(this).find('[placeholder]').each(function() { var input = $(this); if (input.val() == input.attr('placeholder')) { input.val(''); } }) }); } </script> Remove Webkit Search Input Styles Webkit browsers add extra styling to the search input field. To remove them, add the following CSS code: input[type=search] { -webkit-appearance: none;} input[type=\"search\"]::-webkit-search-decoration, input[type=\"search\"]::-webkit-search-cancel-button { display: none; } Credit The jQuery code is found at Nico Hagenburger. Share \u2192 Tweet Previous Quick Interview with Jamie Kosoy @bigspaceship 19 Comments Dave Sparks Mar 28, 2011 @ 11:29 I posted something similar a while ago on my own blog http://www.kamikazemusic.com/quick-tips/jquery-html5-placeholder-fix/ There were concerns raised in the comments about the accessibility of injecting text into the val attribute, personally I think used sensibly and as long as the text is injected with JavaScript then it should be fine, maybe some readers here have a different view? Reply Ren\u00e9 Mar 28, 2011 @ 11:34 I read your post Dave, but I think it\u2019s fine to use it. Only thing I could think of is if you don\u2019t have a seperate label, an older browser, and no Javascript enabled. You don\u2019t see any hints about the field. But hey, who doesn\u2019t have Javascript these days. But I think it\u2019s just great to use this new feature. Reply Ren\u00e9 Mar 28, 2011 @ 11:31 That\u2019s a great feature. Last week I made something like that, but than for Mootools cause I like it better: http://codeviewer.org/view/code:18cf But it\u2019s a powerfull css feature Reply John Catterfeld Mar 28, 2011 @ 11:43 This is a useful resource for seeing what attributes are supported by the modern browsers when styling the placeholder. http://blog.ajcw.com/2011/02/styling-the-html5-placeholder/ It\u2019s not possible to style the placeholder at all in IE9, Opera 10 (and below) or Firefox 3.6, and the rest also have mixed support. Reply Doug Neiner Mar 28, 2011 @ 11:44 Though my comment here doesn\u2019t change the *technical* aspect of the post (providing a fallback for placeholder), I think there is a large problem with the use case of the placeholder. There is a difference between the HTML5 placeholder, and what I call an in-field label (What you are actually showing in this post). The placeholder is supposed to show *how* the user should input data. An in-field label serves the same purpose as a real label, only it appears in (or over) the field. Here are some examples of the difference: Label: Email Placeholder: you@yourname.com Label: Phone number Placeholder: 413-123-4567 Just because the HTML5 placeholder looks like in-field labels we see around, it doesn\u2019t serve the same purpose. If you plan to use the placeholder attribute, you should probably also provide a label. Reply Dave Sparks Mar 28, 2011 @ 12:01 That\u2019s a debate I\u2019ve had with a few people, too many treat it like a label where as a placeholder should simply show the format of an input and not be it\u2019s label. Reply Jonathan Mar 28, 2011 @ 12:17 I think it\u2019s fine to use placeholders as a replacement of labels, it\u2019s cleaner and more condensed. It\u2019s not apart of yesterdays semantic web, but i think tomorrow it should be. Reply Ren\u00e9 Mar 28, 2011 @ 12:24 Well Jonathan, I think that\u2019s different with every person. Personally I really really hate it when my label is gone on focus. Because I tab all my forms, I don\u2019t see what type of input is needed in the next inputfield. So I have to make 2 extra tabs, to see what inputfield I have when there is no seperate label. But hey, that\u2019s me of course Reply Dave Long Mar 29, 2011 @ 08:48 I agree with Rene. For people who tab through forms, which is gaining popularity as forms grow more on the web, not being able to see what type of input is required is just bad coding. That being said, I think it is perfectly acceptable, and I do this all the time, to use placeholders as labels on text inputs that are easy to discern the required data. For example a search form on a website could use a placeholder. They are usually only one field and the submit button will actually help act as a label because it will say something search or just be a search icon. Doug Neiner Mar 28, 2011 @ 12:36 Jonathan, but they serve completely different needs. Even though the HTML5 spec isn\u2019t finalized, the goal of a placeholder is quite different than a label. A label also provides screen-readers with essential information about the field. I am not sure how they do with placeholders. Even though web standards have been widely adopted, mis-using an attribute or element is just as bad as it ever was. Reply Nick La Mar 28, 2011 @ 15:28 I agree with Doug Neiner here, I think label is still required in web form. Label and placeholder serve two different purposes. Placeholder is not equal to label. The entire point of my demo is just to show placeholder (not web standard form). Hence I didn\u2019t even put a submit button in the form. Joe Mar 28, 2011 @ 15:03 You might be interested in \u201cFormalize CSS\u201d http://formalize.me/ It also removes the placeholder text, if you submit the formular, so there is no wrong data submitted. Reply john Mar 28, 2011 @ 18:41 I fail to see how this is better than value. Reply Jon Mar 29, 2011 @ 10:44 2 reasons: 1) Value serves a different purpose. It can be used as the default form submission value when the visitor doesn\u2019t input one, whereas placeholder text is meant to be replaced, and will not return a value if the visitor doesn\u2019t supply one. 2) Without javascript, value doesn\u2019t disappear when the input is clicked. The user has to manually delete it. Reply ethan Mar 28, 2011 @ 23:36 what about password input? Reply Michel Kuik Mar 29, 2011 @ 00:58 Thanks for the helpfull article. I believe it\u2019s quite common to remove the \u2018Chrome\u2019 borders of input boxes with outline:none (on the :focus) state. What\u2019s the difference between this method and input[type=\"search\"]::-webkit-search-decoration? Reply meodai Mar 29, 2011 @ 02:42 The JS could be better. In general, avoid to select twice the same DOM elements. Store stuff in variables if nesseserly. And you should use \u2018===\u2019 instead of \u2018==\u2019 and i wonder why you need a second .blur() after the .blur()\u2026 Reply Jake Mar 29, 2011 @ 02:51 That\u2019s all very well, but why not just use the jQuery code and not bother with the HTML5? This would mean you don\u2019t have to add modernizr to your page load. Reply James A. Rosen Mar 29, 2011 @ 09:43 Be *very* careful when doing this. It interacts very poorly with other jQuery plugins because they can\u2019t tell whether the input\u2019s value is legitimate or not. For example, this completely breaks most autocomplete and combobox plugins.

Music Sales Shed Another $1.4 Billion As Digital Growth Flattens Out Comments (View) Text Size: A A Email Share The trade value of global music sales shrank by 8.4 percent, down to $17.38 billion, in 2010, as the drop-off in physical sales continued (-14.2 percent), according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) trade umbrella\u2019s hefty annual Recording Industry In Numbers report. See more of our latest Metrics coverageor add an alert for future coverage of Metrics. Time was, the business could count on digital sales to make up the difference at some point in the future. But 2010 digital sales growth was just +5.3 percent, its slowest for some years - and it was just +1.2 percent in the U.S., pushed down by a \u201csteep decline\u201d in mobile music sales. Labels represented by IFPI are hoping new retail models like unlimited-subscription can re-ignite industry growth. The IFPI thinks such services, notably Rhapsody and Spotify, have 10 million global subscribers. It also keeps lobbying governments for anti-piracy action that would go in tandem with new legal services, and it\u2019s still trying to manufacturer scenarios in which ISPs would launch some of those services whilst kicking off freeloaders. Global music sales are now 29 percent digital, though that is 49 percent (the same as physical) in the U.S.. Digital sales are 25 percent of the total in the UK, up by a fifth in 2010.

Using a slotted spoon, transfer the tomatoes to the ice water and let sit in the water for 1 minute before removing. Place a sieve over a bowl; working over it, peel the tomatoes using a paring knife, and let the skins fall into the sieve. Halve the tomatoes crosswise and scoop out the seeds with a hooked finger, letting the sieve catch the seeds. Press on the seeds and skins to extract any extra juice. Coarsely chop the peeled tomatoes and set aside. Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant and just beginning to color, 2 to 3 minutes. Add onions and salt, stir to coat, cover and cook, stirring often and adjusting heat as necessary to prevent burning, until soft and turning golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and oregano and cook, stirring often, until the tomato paste is beginning to brown on the bottom of the pan, 2 to 4 minutes. Pour in wine and vinegar; bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits with a spoon. Cook until reduced slightly, about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and any juice; return to a simmer, stirring often. Reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes are mostly broken down, about 25 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in basil and pepper. Transfer the sauce, in batches, to a blender or food processor. (Use caution when pureeing hot liquids.) Process until desired consistency. For a smooth sauce, puree it all; for a chunky sauce, puree just half and mix it back into the rest of the sauce.

This area still retains the historical charm it is famous for. \u00a0 5. Be Amazed At The Notre Dame Basilica- This church was constructed in 1656, and missing this attraction would be a big mistake. Just seeing the exquisite stained glass windows make this church well worth the effort to visit no matter where you are coming from. \u00a0 6. Enjoy The Montreal Botanical Gardens- These gardens are very extensive, and very beautiful. There are paths, ponds, and this can be the perfect place to relax and get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. \u00a0 7. Stroll Through The Place d\u2019Armes- A stroll through the Place d\u2019Armes is one of the top things to do in Montreal. This piazza, or square, is surrounded by beautiful architecture and many shops and eateries and dates back a few hundred years. \u00a0 8. Visit The Montreal Museum Of Archeology- Out of all the Montreal museums, this may be one of the most unusual. You can actually go underground and view the site of the original colony, which dates back to the 1600s. \u00a0 9. Shop Or Browse The Jean Talon Market- The Jean Talon market is one of the favorite things to do in Montreal for visitors and those who reside in the city. This market offers fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as other foods, and is a wonderful place to browse and shop. \u00a0 10. Explore The Montreal Underground City- The underground city is the largest underground complex found around the globe, and allows you to get out of the inclement weather and still enjoy shopping, eating out, and traveling to various parts of Montreal.

That\u2019s a big subject. Where do we start when we\u2019re talking about something that\u00a0isn\u2019t\u00a0here yet?In this article, we\u2019ll look at what the future Web might look like and how we can adapt our current skills to this new environment, as well as how to create fluid websites that are built around a consistent core and that adapt to the limitations and features of the device on which they are viewed. We\u2019ll also look at how our conceptual approach to designing websites should evolve: designing from the simplest design upwards, and not from the richest website down.But before we get to that, let\u2019s start with a question. What do we mean by the \u201cfuture Web\u201d?What Is The Future Web?Back in the old days: analogous Google queries would have taken 30 days. Image: dullhunkThe one word that I hear more than any other at the moment is mobile.\u00a0Mobile websites, mobile devices, mobile apps: the list seems to go on and on. In fact, a large swell of opinion says that the future Web is mobile.But despite all this, focusing just on mobile isn\u2019t the answer.The way we access the Internet is changing, of that we can be certain. And in the short term, this does mean more mobile devices. But in the long term, we have to look a little wider. Thomas Husson, senior analyst for Forrester, summed it up nicely in his 2011 Mobile Trends report when he said, \u201cThe term mobile will mean a lot more than mobile phones.\u201d In the long term, the word we should use instead of mobile is portable.Why Portable? How Has the Internet Changed to Make It So?First, the physical infrastructure of the Internet is spreading rapidly, so that our ability to access the Internet wherever we are grows daily. In the last 10 years, the number of Internet users has grown by 444.8% and now includes 28.7% of the population. That\u2019s nearly 2 billion people, the majority of whom are in Asia. This growth is fuelled by investment in the underlying hardware that gives us access to the Internet: millions and millions of computers, millions of miles of cables, hundreds of thousands of wireless hotspots and, on top of all this, growing 3G coverage around the globe (around 21% by the end of 2010 according to Morgan Stanley).Secondly, the way we use the Internet is changing. We are increasingly orienting our online experience around services rather than search engines. Services such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn are becoming the hub for our online life, and we are blending them to create our own unique Web of content: Facebook for our social life, LinkedIn for our professional life, Spotify for music, Netflix for television and film. We\u2019re seeing a very different form of information consumption here, one in which we expect information to be pushed to us through our social circle, the people whom we trust. We\u2019re moving away from the old paradigm of information retrieval, in which we are expected to seek information using search engines and links.Some of these services are tied to a single device, but increasingly they are available across multiple platforms, including the desktop, mobile apps, Internet-enabled TVs and others. Only last month, Samsung created the first tweeting refrigerator. Okay, that might not be the greatest use of an Internet connection, but it is an example of how these services are starting to spread out, away from the desktop and into our everyday lives. Evrythng, a start-up currently in beta, is working on a platform that would give any physical object an online presence, effectively making the Internet an ubiquitous entity containing data that can be consumed anywhere and by anything.Given these changes, it\u2019s important that we not be overly rigid in our approach to creating new Web content; we mustn\u2019t allow ourselves to think in terms of devices. Right now, we are producing mobile apps and standard websites to deliver our services, but in a few years\u2019 time, we may be looking at a completely different landscape, one where knowing exactly where and how our content is being viewed is impossible. Our content must be portable in the sense that it can be displayed anywhere. Media marketers have responded to the increasing use of mobile media. (Image: birgerking)We may also find ourselves having to decide whether to concentrate on particular devices and channels at the expense of audience numbers or to take a less tailored approach and serve the widest spectrum possible.Regardless of the route we take, the ability to deliver a consistent experience across all channels is paramount, and our ability as designers and developers to understand the options and deliver this consistency to our clients will be crucial.So, this is the future Web, a mish-mash of devices and channels. Sounds good, doesn\u2019t it? Let\u2019s go back to the key word, portability.How Do We Design For The Portable Web?Ask yourself, how would your latest project cope in the following scenarios:The user is watching House on their new Internet TV. Hugh Laurie\u2019s not on screen, so the user decides to check their email. A friend has sent a link to your website, which the user opens in a sidebar and views simultaneously with the program.The user is on a train back from work, probably delayed somewhere, accessing your website via 3G on an iPadThe user is on a client\u2019s website. They need to access your website to read an article, but they have only a company-supplied Sony Ericsson with Opera Mini installed.Each of these scenarios presents us with a different problem to solve: (1) an odd aspect-ratio and browser combination, (2) a good display area but slow connection and (3) a very small display area. And they are all very possible scenarios. The first Internet TVs by big brands are now available from the big retailers. Opera Mini has over 85.5 million users and is the dominant browser in many areas of the world; in fact, in Asia, Opera and Nokia (with their combined 66.33% market share) are way ahead of the third-place browser (which is BlackBerry, with a 9.81% share). And Deloitte has predicted that 2011 will be the year of the tablet and that 50% of the \u201ccomputing devices\u201d sold will not be PCs.Chances are that, unless you\u2019ve really thought about it (and if you have, then you probably don\u2019t need to read this article), your website won\u2019t work in all of those cases.When designing for the portable Web, we need to be aware of three things: design, content and integration. Approached in the right way, we can create websites that are accessible across the widest user base and that provide a consistent experience regardless of access method.Consistent? How?When faced with a multitude of devices to design for, all with varying specifications, the last goal that might come to mind is consistency, and with good reason. And yet we should be striving to achieve consistency. Not in design but in experience.Conceptually, we should be thinking about our design in two layers: the core content or service, and then the display layer. The core of our website should not change from device to device, and it should deliver a consistent experience. As we shall see shortly, this means that we must ensure that elements such as the content and the navigation patterns work the same way always.The web\u2019s future consists of vast possibilities, considering them all is virtually impossible. That is why we need consistency! Image: Juhan SoninLet\u2019s say our user is at work and is browsing our website on an iPad. They work through the carefully designed navigation hierarchy to get to the piece of content that they want to read, but they are interrupted by a phone call and have to stop browsing. Later, on the train home, they access the website again, this time via their phone. The visual elements of the design will be different\u2014by necessity\u2014but crucially, the routes they took to find the content should be exactly the same, as should the content they read when they got there.This consistency of experience is what will allow us to create great websites for the portable Web and a complete user experience.Where Do I Start? And How Will I Know When I Get There?If a single consistent experience is our goal, this begs the question, should we create a mobile website that scales up or a desktop website that degrades?The answer is\u00a0neither. We should try to create a single design that can be used across all devices without alteration. But in practice, at least for the moment, we should start with the simplest website and work up.Why? Let\u2019s go back to the introduction. On the portable Web, we have no control over how our content will be used or viewed, and as such we must throw out the idea that we are designing for a particular device or device size. We must approach the design of our website in a different way, one in which we create the core content or service first. After all, this will define our website in the end, not the visual elements. This may seem difficult initially, but as we shall see, many of the best practices for desktop website development hold true for the portable Web, especially with regard to content structure.<img src=\"http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/3096440676_40d71ed11c.j alt=\" in Designing For The Future Web\" />WE need consistency like the inside of a pepper. Image by Sean RogersTo recap, here are the key rules to bear in mind when working through a design for the portable Web:The website should be available to as wide an audience as possible;The website should contain the same content wherever it is viewed, where feasible;The website\u2019s structure should be the same wherever it is viewed;The content should be displayed in a manner that is appropriate to its environment.A website that meets all of these criteria would fit snugly in the future portable Web. But how do we go about making our websites do this?Designing For The Portable WebDesign Using Web Standards: That Means HTML5 The good news is that the two most common browser engines on mobile, Webkit and Opera, both support HTML5 very well; Webkit has supported HTML5 at least partially since November 2007.Using standard and descriptive mark-up throughout our websites will have the benefit of delivering consistent output across most devices. And the extended capabilities of HTML5 to deliver media, animation and local storage make it a great choice for mobile applications.These three abilities allow HTML5 websites to reproduce behaviours usually associated with native mobile applications, closing the experience gap between the two. Video can now be played natively through HTML5 using the video tag, while animations can be played using the HTML5 canvas. Finally, local storage allows a website to store database-like information on the device, allowing for fully functional offline use of the website.YouTube, Netflix and Gmail all have HTML5 versions of their websites that are designed for the mobile experience and that take advantage of the new capabilities of HTML5. They\u2019re a great starting point for any developer who wants to see what can be achieved.HTML5 is now ready to be used for development, and there\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t start right away. Many excellent resources and tutorials are available to help you get started:Dive into HTML5 An overview of the HTML5 standard and a great starting point.HTML5 Demos and Examples A series of demonstrations showing the capabilities of HTML5, with source code.HTML5 Gallery A showcase of websites created in HTML5.To get started using HTML5 in your projects, you can take advantage of any one of the number of development environments that support it. The most complete implementation is through Adobe\u2019s Dreamweaver CS5; an HTML5 support pack can be downloaded that extends the built-in editor. Aptana also supports HTML5 in its beta of Aptana Studio 3. Links are provided at the end of this article.Start Simple, Work UpThinking portable means thinking clean and simple. The wide variation in screen sizes\u2014from a 40-inch LCD running at 1920 \u00d7 1080 pixels to a portrait-orientation mobile screen at 320 \u00d7 240 pixels\u2014means that we must create designs that are scalable and adaptive. We must also be aware that someone may be interacting via a remote control or a fat stubby finger on a touchscreen. The simpler the design, the more adaptable it will be.Bottom up conceptualizing males sense. Concentrate on the basic elements and let the context evolve around them. Image: Andrei BocanCreate your basic website structure first and add only your core styles, the ones that are applicable to all devices and layouts. Starting simple gives us a great base on which to build. Essentially, we are starting from the most basic experience, available on even the smallest mobile device, and working our way up to the more capable desktop browsers.Using @media queries in the CSS will enable your website to recognize the additional capabilities of desktop browsers and scale up for these environments, presenting a fuller and more interactive experience where possible.A word of caution and a reason why we don\u2019t work the other way around by degrading a desktop website to a mobile one: @media queries are not supported by every mobile device. Rachel Andrews provides a good overview of @media queries\u00a0here on Smashing Magazine, albeit working from desktop to mobile, rather than the other way round.Forget About ProprietaryWhatever you do, stay away from the proprietary technologies, because that\u2019s the one way to guarantee an inconsistent experience. Flash and Silverlight as development platforms are living on borrowed time. Microsoft has already indicated that it will discontinue Silverlight development to concentrate on HTML5, while Flash is being used mainly as a game development platform and video-delivery mechanism. If we are going to create truly cross-platform websites that display consistently across all devices, then Flash and Silverlight are not wise choices because we cannot be certain that they will be installed on the user\u2019s device. Not to say that Flash doesn\u2019t have its place; as a platform for Web-based games, it is currently unrivalled. It\u2019s about choosing the best technologies for the job at hand.Be Wary of JavaScript\u2026 for the Time BeingThe bad news is that we may have to sacrifice some of the things we take for granted now. We must learn to design for unknown screen sizes and ratios and allow content to flow as required. Think less about design structure and page layout and more about content structure.We may have to forgo using JavaScript and AJAX (both staples of desktop development) to create more involving user experiences, because some lower-end devices will not have the hardware muscle to deal with complex libraries. Trimming page weight will also be a priority because we cannot be certain that end users will have broadband-speed access to the Internet, so large libraries will be unacceptable overhead.This is particularly important in light of the recent \u201chash bang\u201d trend, started with Gawker Media\u2019s controversial redesign of its websites. The websites (including Gizmodo, Lifehacker and Gawker) present a more application-like experience to users, but do so by relying on JavaScript for content delivery. In effect, the websites consist of a single page that is loaded with dynamic content on request, instead of the multiple pages that they consisted of previously. Any users whose browsers cannot process the JavaScript, for whatever reason, will be unable to browse the website; they are greeted with only a blank page.However, a number of libraries are being developed to be lightweight and usable on portable devices. jQuery has an alpha of its mobile library available for testing. The project has the backing of industry players such as BlackBerry, Mozilla and Adobe, so it is worth keeping an eye on.JavaScript support will mature as devices worldwide move onto more modern platforms and as older devices are taken out of service. But for the time being, a conservative approach to its use will mean a wider potential audience for your work.Test, Test, Then Test AgainOn the portable Web, there\u2019s a good chance we won\u2019t be able to test against every possible platform on which our content will be viewed. But that doesn\u2019t take away the need to test. And test we must. Opera Mini\u2019s emulator lets you test your website in a virtual browser.Buying a device from each platform would be prohibitive for the majority of designers. But alternatives are available. For most of the main platforms, device emulators are available that simulate the browsing experience. See the resources section at the end of this article for links.At the other end of the scale, a paid service is available from DeviceAnywhere, which enables you to test your website on over 2000 handsets.Unfortunately, there are no Internet TV emulators so far, but Google has released a guide to designing for Google TV.Finally, of course, we mustn\u2019t forget to test on our desktop browsers, too. The aim of designing for the portable Web is to create a single experience across as wide a set of devices as possible. Just because users are able to browse the Web in many ways doesn\u2019t mean they will stop using their desktop, laptop or netbook. Use this to your advantage when testing simply by resizing your browser to ensure that your design scales and flows appropriately. The emulators will provide you with an exact rendering of your website on other devices.The Ugly Duckling?So, does the portable Web defy beauty and kick sand in the face of outstanding design? Of course not. Great design is not only about visual imagery, but about presenting information clearly, which involves hierarchy and importance through innovative and well-thought out typography, layouts and navigation. Which brings us to\u2026Content For The Portable WebContent is once again king. The rise of Quora should be enough to convince anyone of that; it is a service based solely on content. On the portable Web, this is doubly true. By paring down the design elements, you leave even more focus on the content.Understand What\u2019s ImportantIdentifying what is most critical to users should be your first task when developing a portable website. There may not be room for complex navigation, especially on smaller screens, so keep it simple. Compare the mobile and desktop versions of YouTube\u2019s start page: YouTube\u2019s standard home page. YouTube\u2019s HTML5-based home page works brilliantly on small screens.Create a Solid Information HierarchyStructuring our content is important, for both readability and SEO. Understanding the content that we are presenting is essential to creating clear information hierarchies that guide users through it.Map the user\u2019s possible journeys through your content. There should be a clear route to every piece of content, starting with the top-level information categories and getting more granular with each click. John Lewis\u2019 mobile website has a clear information hierarchy to aid navigation.A good example of this is the mobile website of John Lewis, a UK-based department store. From the home page, you can easily drill down to each department, and from there to individual products. It\u2019s simple, and it also means that the amount of information on any given page is not overwhelming and that you know exactly where you are in the hierarchy at all times.Keep Content AvailableEven if users aren\u2019t on a desktop, don\u2019t treat them as second-class citizens. Provide as much content as is feasible. And for what content there is, present it appropriately. Remove the following:Superfluous images If an image isn\u2019t essential to the content, get rid of it.Unsupported file formats Don\u2019t include Flash or even the Flash placeholder if the file likely can\u2019t be played.Unnecessary text Good desktop copy doesn\u2019t necessarily make for good portable copy. Is that second customer testimonial absolutely necessary? If not, remove it.While we want to remove unnecessary content, we don\u2019t want to remove too much. In the example below, we have a simple accessible website, but one that has no depth. The first level of information is presented well, but the headings for the company\u2019s services at the bottom of the page should link to the next level of information. The way it is, if I want to find out more, I\u2019m forced to visit the non-optimized website. This is a poor user experience, because it makes finding what I need more difficult. Sapient Nitro\u2019s mobile website displays really well but cuts a lot of information from the full website.Integration And The Portable WebIf services are to become the new hub of the Internet, keeping our websites linked to these services becomes paramount.Keep It ModularServices will come and go (although the main ones will certainly remain for a long time yet\u2026 yes, I\u2019m looking at you, Facebook), so keep your design modular. Being able to integrate with new services as they come online and to prune away those that have fallen by the wayside will ensure that your content is available to the widest possible audience.The goal is to make it easy to push your content across multiple services and thus integrate your content into the fabric of the Web. Primarily, this will be through search engine optimization and social sharing.Make Your Content Search-Engine FriendlyWhile the way people access content is becoming more social and less search-based, search engines are still a massive source of traffic. Keeping your content formatted for easy retrieval is a must. Quora has done this extremely well, leading to high rankings across the major search engines and generating traffic for its next-generation Q&A service. SEO may be old hat for some, but as quality of content becomes increasingly important, it will gain new life. Quora plays nice with search engines, with great results.Make Sharing EasySEO is important, but so are direct connections to other services through OAuth, OpenGraph and OpenID. If this isn\u2019t an option for you, then at the very least give users some way to share your content. Services like AddThis and ShareThis make it simple to add sharing capabilities; take advantage of them. A single tweet can generate a lot of activity. Of course, modern development and content platforms such as WordPress have this functionality built in.Bringing these three elements together will create websites that are discoverable, consistent and usable. Just one question now is raising its ugly head\u2026What About Apps? Aren\u2019t They The Way Forward? Apps are big business. Gartner forecasts that mobile app store revenue will top $15 billion in 2011. It\u2019s no surprise that Google, Microsoft, Nokia and others are trying to get in on the act. But just because app stores are commercially successful, does it mean they should be our first point of call when designing for the future Web?Let\u2019s look at why one might want to create an app:Easy to purchase, install, use and throw away Apps are so usable that even your granny could use them. Installing them on a smartphone is a smooth process that requires minimal involvement from the user. And when you\u2019ve had enough, you simply delete it and no trace of the app remains. This is a great user experience, period. That\u2019s why Apple is now pushing the same concept for full-blown Mac apps through the Mac App Store. Apps also provide, in most cases, a good user experience, with their native controls and design patterns.Brand association and lock-in Apps are designed to do one thing and do it well. The most successful apps are exercises in brand association: \u201cI want to search the Web, so I\u2019ll use the Google app,\u201d or \u201cI want to check up on my friends, so I\u2019ll use the Facebook app.\u201d You experience the brand through the app. I could easily use the Safari browser on the iPhone to access both Facebook and Google, but the apps make it easy for me. I\u2019m locked into the experience, which is great for the companies because their brands get planted square in the middle of my home screen; in this case, a big F and a big G.Money The most attractive thing about apps to many companies is the profit. Apple\u2019s App Store has shown that monetizing content is possible. Even for independent developers, making a lot of money in a relatively short period of time is possible.What\u2019s remarkable about all of these points is that they have nothing to do with information consumption. They are all about brand and user experience. However, there are also reasons why you should think twice:Apps are information silos: Apps do what they do well. But they don\u2019t do a good job of bringing in the wider Web. Want to follow a link? You might be able to view the page in app, but you\u2019re just as likely to get thrown out into the browser. That\u2019s not a good user experience. You also lose control of the user\u2019s actions and their focus on your content.Apps are platform-specific: Writing an app automatically ties you to the platform you are writing it for. This immediately limits your potential audience. Smartphone penetration is growing but is still a small segment of the overall Internet-enabled phone market. To take the US market as an example, even though 31% of the population have smartphones, only 6% of the population have iPhones. That\u2019s 19 million out 307 million. If you released an iOS-only app in the US, you would immediately lose 76.17 million potential users.Apps work best for big brands and services: Regardless of how good the app is, you have to find a way to get it discovered among the tidal wave of apps that are released into app stores every day. Big brands can push their apps through their existing Web presence, but that\u2019s a lot more difficult for smaller brands. And unless you can generate a lot of relevant content regularly, as the major services do, your app will be consigned to the trash very quickly. Research by Pinch Media (now Flurry) shows that free apps are used primarily in the first 10 days following installation, and then rapidly trail off to around 2% of the installation base after 70 days. Paid application usage drops off even more quickly.Mobile users prefer browsers over apps: A study by Keynote Systems in October 2010 shows that users prefer mobile websites for nearly all types of Web content. The only categories in which apps came out on top were social networking, music and games, which makes sense because these apps usually take full advantage of a native platform\u2019s capabilities.So, if we want to create something with more permanence, that can evolve at a speed that suits us and our clients, then we need to look away from mobile apps and towards the mobile Web. We must execute good design, thoughtful content and solid integration to tie our portable websites into the social infrastructure of the Web.ConclusionThe fully portable Web may not be here right now, but it will be before we know it. As it was with the browser wars, developers and designers must re-educate themselves to become the driving force behind these changes and be brave enough to let go of current design thinking and work to set new standards. Understanding how to create online presences that take full advantage of all platforms and preparing for the future shape of the Web will position us not just as technicians, but as people who can provide real value to our clients.ResourcesThe HTML5 editors and device emulators mentioned above can be downloaded from the following websites.HTML5 development environments:CS5 HTML5 Support Pack (part of the\u00a0CS5 11.0.3 Updater), plus\u00a0tutorialAptana 3 betaDevice emulators:AndroidOpera MiniApple iPhone (via iOS SDK)Windows Mobile (look for the latest Windows Phone Developer Tools)BlackBerryNokia Mobile Browser(al) (ik)Tweet James GardnerJames Gardner is a digital strategist working at Volume, one of the largest independent B2B digital marketing agencies in the UK.

I am currently studying webdesign and I always thought about scaling my sites down for mobile, but you\u2019re right. The other approach makes a lot more sense.Thanks! :) Reply 4-1 Lukigi March 29th, 2011 4:41 amGreat article! I reckon consistence is the key. Personally I don\u2019t like mobile versions. First think I do when I land on mobile version of a website is to look if I can switch to desktop version. Somehow I always have the feeling that content is limited and the experience I get is too different to the standard (Desktop) version I\u2019m used to.My personal take on this is that mobile devices are giving us better and better experience, faster connections, better quality screens, more processing power. Apple and Google both know that some content (often high quality) on internet will never be optimized for mobile, as it is made by people who are expert on their subjects but not necessarily on web design. And yes websites quality is going up, especially thanks to web templates but the progress is nowhere close to that of mobile devices.Make websites light, simple, flexible and standard friendly and let the mobile industry do the rest. Reply 50 Ivor March 29th, 2011 5:02 amJames, good article, however your information about silverlight is incorrect. Microsoft are not giving up on Silverlight, SL5 is just around the corner. The only thing different is the direction Microsoft are taking Silverlight, compared to HTML5. Reply 60 Danny Rigby March 29th, 2011 5:09 amGood, slightly daunting stuff.

It would be a horrible user experience to find a website while viewing it from a laptop or desktop computer to be styled as a mobile site. Reply 110 Shane March 29th, 2011 6:50 am@Aaron, right on. And for similar reasons I disagree with: \u201cThe website\u2019s structure should be the same wherever it is viewed.\u201d The website\u2019s (and I\u2019m not sure that term is even applicable as internet appliances change the way they acquire content) structure should be adaptive to it\u2019s environment (e.g. device, bandwidth etc.). The content a user wishes to view on her phone will, in most cases, be largely different from what she is interested in seeing in the comforts of her home, or office where screen real-estate, bandwidth, and most likely time are more abundant.Great article, but I do take exception with this point. Reply 12+2 Billy March 29th, 2011 5:54 amIn your article you mentioned stay away from proprietary technology. I\u2019m a designer and I have yet to see a standard on the web. You further make the comment that you need to test test test. If the web was such an organized standard why would you need to test so much. In my opinion using Flash or other like technologies provides a consistent experience unlike the web standards we currently conform to. Think about how Acrobat has changed our lives. If we abandoned this proprietary software and went with a \u201cstandard\u201d would we be better off. Some may say yes, but I would say from a business perspective, No. This single application allows anybody to create rich interactive content (no coding) and share it with anybody and it remains consistent without regard for the browser or OS all you need is the plugin. And if you wanted to make the bandwidth argument, well lets look at the amount of Java and other code you have to download remotely just to get a page to work. There no shortage of solutiosn but by removing tools from my toolbox that solves nothing except for the people that want to maintain there position.Can you image if each software developer had to make every copy of their software compliant on all OS platforms new and old. You think you have buggy and expensive software now. I equate that to the web standard. Think about it you have five major browsers and within each browsers multiple versions. Lets say there are five major browsers and five version within, that\u2019s 25 separate host applications that have to be accounted for. That\u2019s not a standard that is a quagmire.Sorry for the vent but the web has become a very unfriendly environment for designers IMHO. Reply 130 Recep K\u00fct\u00fck March 29th, 2011 7:04 amI knew someone would heed the call and respond Vitaly\u2019s last article with a well-thought one. Thanks a lot James, you obviously took the extra mile and trouble to bring such detailed, informative and enlightening article together.The thing that bothers me about the \u201cportable web\u201d is that, when you are about to say something about it you have to be extra cautious and need to use words like \u201cas x as possible\u201d, \u201cwhenever feasible\u201d, \u201cwherever appropriate\u201d etc. That makes me feel like the subject is blurry, no room left for certain predictions. The fight to overcome browser inconsistencies was something, but another fight to explore and overcome the inconsistencies between devices? The very devices that are interacted with inconsistent conventions? I already feel exhausted, f this s.I could only find relief in one part of the article, the one that the user chooses \u201chouse\u201d over my \u201cdays-spent, well-put, cleverly planned, carefully detailed\u201d content. To be honest, I don\u2019t care if I lose this one..The situation now reminds me the fear I had when I had to give up good ole ie6 friendly table based designs and had to learn the magical world of standards and css. I hope I will be thinking how unnecessary my fear was and will be laughing at this very comment, in 3 years from now :)Thanks again James, you sure gave us something to (carefully) rant about!

The paper that Trump released says \"Jamaica Hospital\" on top and lists the date and time of what he says was his birth to \"Mr. and Mrs. Fred C. Trump.\" The piece of paper has a seal at the bottom. \u00a0 But after several New York City-based readers contacted POLITICO's Maggie Haberman, her call to city officials revealed that an actual birth certificate, which is issued by the Department of Health, would have the agency's seal and also a signature of the city registrar - neither of which the Trump document has. Officials said the city Health Department is the \"sole issuing authority\" of official birth certificates in New York, and that the document would clearly say so, and \"city officials said it's not an official document.\" It appears instead to be a hospital \"certificate of birth,\" meaning the piece of paper the hospital gave to his family saying he was born. Such a document typically has the signature of the hospital administrator and the attending physician. Trump lawyer and advisor Michael Cohen didn't respond to Haberman's question about the document. Trump's mother, it should be noted, was born in Scotland, which is not part of the United States. His plane is registered in the Bahamas, also a foreign country. This fact pattern -- along with the wave of new questions surrounding what he claims is a birth certificate -- raises serious doubts about his eligibility to serve as President of the United States.

Albeit one with a billion dollars but a fool nonetheless. He has disgraced his name. Isn't his third or fourth wife a foreigner? Can she be First Lady as a foreigner? Seems to me Obama has more family roots in American than Trump, whose mother is from Scotland and whose wife is from Yugoslavia I believe.

Based on this and newspaper announcements Obama was definitely born in Hawaii. There are 2 reasons why he refuses to produce the full birth certificate. There may be something embarassing on it like how race was filled out (if it listed) or maybe religion- Islam maybe (if it is listed). Second, and most likely is that he is playing birthers like a fiddle and hoping Republicans get tagged with a radical image.

I read this on the Internets, so you know it must be true. And if I repeat it over and over again that al-Qaeda made this story up and gave it to Republican Party operatives then it must be true, right. Isn't that how this works? I just keep repeating that the story about President Obama not being born in the United States was made up by al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda then gave the story to Republican Party operatives like Donald Trump to spread on Fox (Fake) News and the right-wing media. You just keep repeating it, over, and over, and over again.

Just ask the Republicans (or Donald Trump). Posted By: ConeyIslandBaby | March 28, 2011 at 09:11 PM Report Abuse Here's what's funny. Obama was scrutinized and vetted not only by the press, but political rivals from both parties more than any other candidate I can remember. When rightwingers say that Obama wasn't \"vetted,\" what they mean is that the free press and their fellow citizens didn't arrive at the conclusions that conservatives wanted them too. Everybody was aware of the various Chicago connections, Rev. Wright, etc. etc., during the election because conservatives couldn't stop talking about it - and the MSM covered it ad nauseum (Obama even made a major speech about Wright - remember?). It's just that everybody else examined the facts and came to a different conclusion than a loud minority of conservatives. Same thing with the birth certificate. The birthers think there's some big conspiracy when in fact everyone else besides them who examined the same facts concluded there was no issue, that the birth certificate provided was legitimate and sufficient, etc. To a certain breed of conservative, \"bias\" simply means \"not agreeing with what I say.\" \"Not vetting properly\" means \"not arriving at the same conclusions I have\"; and conspiracy means \"not interpreting the facts they way I have, and the way I want you to.\" For some reason I thought Trump was a better man than this, but obviously I was wrong. He deserves all the ridicule he will get over this fiasco.

Just being a legal U.S. citizen doesn't cut presidential Constitutional requirements. The framers spelled out in Article I, and II: The legislative branch spells out \"citizen,\" and for the president, a \"natural born citizen. That was not a mistake, because the framers used Vittale's \"Laws of Nations.\". Obama's mother was an American citizen, and his father was a Kenyan citizen, or British subject, of which would make Obama a U.S. \"citizen,\" and \"British subject,\" but not a \"natural born citizen.\" Hence, he never legally qualified to fulfill Constitutional muster. Sure Stanley Ann Dunham was an American citizen, and Obama's father was a Kenyan citizen, of which made Barry a dual citizen, exactly contrary to what the framers of the Constitution had in mind when they wrote the Article II clause of \"natural born citizen.\" Posted By: Jackson Pearson | March 28, 2011 at 11:30 PM Report Abuse \"As I read through the comments, it's pretty clear that you got 'em, Ben.

Birth, however, derives its force sometimes from place, and sometimes from parentage; but, in general place is the most certain criterion; it is what applies in the United States.

After all, no representative of the Department of Health, which issues official certificates, was present at the birth but the attending physician was. In fact, the City obtains the information about births from hospitals and bases the official records on that information. Similarly, death certificates are issued and recorded based on information supplied by hospitals and doctors or in some cases by coroners or even undertakers.

The paper they were issued on were small, rectangular (vertically), and YES, they did have a time and date stamped across the top of them, but I believe this is the time of FILING, not the time of actual birth. The papers were issued to mothers on black paper with white writing. Essentially, I believe this would have been a \"photo\" (maybe microfiche??) of the original birth certificate that would have been written on white paper with pen by the doctor or nurse. Factual error: While it's the NYC Department of Health that governs such things, it is SPECIFICALLY the now-centralized NYC Department of Vital Records that you go to for re-issues of birth certificates. They can only be obtained by the original person or, if that person is dead, by family members for the purposes of genaeology. I know this because I have both my original BC and an \"original copy\" that was obtained from Vital Records when I lost my BC for an extended period of time and needed it for proof of ID. The NEW BC's are on security paper, printed by a dot-matrix printer, and contain a seal. The original contrasts sharply with it in the lack of security features that it had. Don't judge this book by its cover just yet. I don't give a flying hoot if Trump wants to run for office. I really don't. What I DO want is accuracy in reporting and a faithful understanding of the FACTS before people start becoming \"birthers\" every time a potential president they don't like wants to run for office.

The mother and / or father could be naturalized or have become citizens by law - but they must be citizens. It matters not where the person was born. Neither Don nor Barry meet that condition as one of their parents was not a citizen. Both Don and Barry are citizens, but not natural born. That is what the founders contended and the reason that they exempted themselves from that condition of being president. Read what they actually wrote, not someone opinion about what they wrote.

Posted By: desertdaze | March 29, 2011 at 07:50 AM Report Abuse Can understand why you're confused. The issue with Obama's birth is that there is no hospital birth certificate. True, it's not a legal document, the certificate of live birth issued by the state is which Obama has provided is and that determines US citizenship. It's usually issued by the state when the hospital sends the paperwork over but one can be requested by immediate relatives to register their child with the state as is normally done for home/non-hospital births. What has been a little odd is that Obama himself alludes to the hospital he was born in but no hospital has any record of his birth. And that is what Trump has been referring to/why he submitted his hospital certificate. Since Obama wasn't born at any of the local hospitals, he was likely born at home, another state or country. Either Obama's parents didn't tell him where he was actually born or he hasn't been truthful about it all along. If it was at home or another state, not a big deal. But another country...that's another story. Posted By: Chris C | March 29, 2011 at 07:52 AM Report Abuse Wow did the libs just admit that a COLB proves nothing about being \"natural born citizen\"?

Nothing else to talk about so lets continue to focus on someone's birth cirtificate. HELLO PEOPLE!! \"It's all old news!!\" I realize when running for President of the United States of America, the individual needs to be a person litterally born in the US to run in the election not to mention run the country. I would think by now, whatever the process is to allow someone to cast their ballot to run for the United States of America as president, you just can't announce that \"I am running for President of the USA\" in a press confrence and it makes it official. There is a whole application process, and although it may not be perfect and have flaws like any process, making sure the person running for the Office of President and Vice-President of the United States of America, verifying his or her place of birth would be all part of the process before approving the candidate to run for the office then announce via press confrence that it is official. You don't need to apply to announce you are considering running, only when making it official is there the application process to be approved to make an official announcement. If you don't like the president regardless the reason, be it him as a person or his religious beliefs, how he is running the country, etc, just say so and not continue to bring up what was started over 2 years ago. It's old news that there are those who assume and/or don't believe he was born here, that's your right to your opinion or assumption on your part. Why are we living in the past and not the present. We have more important issues to worry about than what happened 2 years ago that has nothing to do with today. Get over it and move on or go start your own country of haters and disbelievers or anything coming from anyones mouth or documentation. I'm glad my life is not so boring I still need to be obsessed about the past. If any of you can do better at running the country, then run for president yourself so everyone can pick apart all aspects of your life from where you were born, how you were born, why you were born, and any other minor issue someone can complain about your person or imperfections. We are made in the \"likeness\" of Jesus, (or whoever you believe in)we are NOT Jesus. He has the final say on our life not us when it comes to our death and how we lived our life.

I am a bit confused by this issue. I thought the USA was a national of federated states and that unless a matter was federal law each state could pass its own laws. This being so it would seem to me as an outsider that certification of birth would vary from state to state so any statements about what happens is New York or Dakota are utterly beside the point. I am also puzzled because hear in the UK we saw the Republican governor of Hawaii make a statement saying that President Obama's birth was correctly registered as required by that State's law. Were you not allowed to see this broadcast in the USA? Most references give his DOB as August 4th 1961. If he had been born in Kenya at this, pre independence date. he would have been registered as a British citizen and his birth certificate would be a matter of public record. He would have had to have a bieth certificate to obtain a British passport to travel abroad or to have had a sworn statement made by a Commissioner of Oaths, an act that would have required a great deal of corroboration.I think it is quite beyond the bounds of probability to argue that someone within Kenya would not have checked back and discovered such a record if it existed.

Posted By: Cindy | March 29, 2011 at 11:00 AM Report Abuse That's priceless, if Trump would be in question of becoming president then obama should be thrown in Jail for fraud for falsely stating he was born in the U.S. if in fact he was born else where. Posted By: wasnt me | March 29, 2011 at 11:03 AM Report Abuse Love it!!! Posted By: Trumpisanidiot | March 29, 2011 at 11:17 AM Report Abuse Anyone who has the right thinking would understand this: , that time when Obama (senior) came to study in USA, and met the mother to President, he was a young student. He had no money at all, he was brought to USA by Kenyan Gov. who paid the fare and his stay during his studies. He had no money to fly back to Kenya with a pregnant student and let her deliver in Kenya. He had again no money to pay the fare for 3 of them and fly back to USA. It is just simple reasoning which make \"birthers\" look silly & stupid! Posted By: freedom | March 29, 2011 at 11:21 AM Report Abuse It is increasingly becoming more apparent as we move forward in this civil society, a number of people are being fooled and seduced by some rich and powerful elite into ignorance instead of seeking to educate themselves knowledgeably. Trump's loud mouth confirms his illiteracy and ignorance of how public figures, national and political representatives are vetted and selected including the head of this nation, the President of United States. How dumb could United States of America with all its intelligence be fooled or magically be hypnotized to belief President Obama is not an American and not born in the United States and become a President? If this is so, former Presidential Candidate, Senator McCain and his campaign machine would easily have dug this early in the primaries. No wonder in Proverbs 18:15 \" The discerning heart seeks knowledge, but the mouth of a fool feeds on folly\" also in Hosea 4:6 \"my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge, because you have rejected knowledge.\" Trump must use his loud mouth and wealth to nourish many, and not seek to bear false witness. Trump has succeeded in making wealth, but its time now to seek the spiritual knowledge and the truth and not Trump.

He may have lots of money, but money doesn't make the man. He's just another substandard offering from a floundering GOP.

Secondly, I see some people in the comments claiming the constitution says both parents have to be US citizens for the baby to be elligible to be president of the USA. I guess this means that you should remove from the records anyone that was born before 1776. Since his parents would be British subjects. And I find it a bit starnge that the founding fathers made the constition in a way that means George Washington could not have been president of the USA. Hmmm...maybe the founding fathers meant something else then... Posted By: Norwegian Viking | March 29, 2011 at 11:33 AM Report Abuse this article is a FAIL, trump provided what obama CANT, the ACTUAL cert from the ACTUAL DAY he was born from the ACTUAL hospital, SORRY, this document is MORE genuine than the STATE document because it is thge ORIGINAL that the state doc SLAVES off of, For the record, trump is an ass and is the lowest of the 500 billionaires, he is poor compered ot them. Now the state of hawaii says that obamas cert is DESTROYED, AND, a woman that had twins in the same hospital as obama was born in, the day BEFORE he was born, has shown the ORIGINALS for her TWINS, and her SEQUENCE number is HIGHER than OBAMAS, so, evdiently, he was born BEFORE her twins, yet 24 hours later, go figure, hard to get that crap straight when u forge docs.

He signed NOTHING. U cant impeach him or prosecute him for holding office either, he flubbed the oath, on purpose, then did it AGAIN, supposedly, behind closed doors, not called for in the constitution. So u cant do NOTHING to him. U ALLOWED HIM TO TAKE THE SEAT KNOWING, OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN, he was illegitimate and not sworn in per the constitution, its YOUR fault and HE is a VICTIM.

Posted By: Leftwingnotalwaysright | March 29, 2011 at 11:50 AM Report Abuse for the person in uk that wanted clarification on voting, yes, 50 states, to run for pres u have to submit to EVERY state and satisfy their laws. HOWEVER, obama did not do this HIMSELF, he ran on behalf of a PARTY, therefore, it was up to that PARTY to have done the DUE DILIGENCE in determining his ELGIBILITY to hold the office (born here not a felon meets minimum age etc). So the DNC did the filing in every 50 states, not obama, he signed NOTHING. And, another tidbit, thats a FACT, in every filing PRIOR to obama, they have a line in the ceritfication letter from the DNC to the states, thats states, he meets the eligibility requirements, if any, of the office sought regarding ctizenship and or birth place. THIS LINE WAS OMITTED IN 49 of the 50 STATES when the DNC filed his paperwork, Only in Hawaii was it left in. And all 49 states accepted the filing with that required line MISSING. thereby allowing him on the ballot. THIS IS WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE STOPPED, but not ONE PERSON in any of those state called the DNC out on this. It was UNPRECEDENTED for that ONE LINE to have been OMITTED in a filing, And it has not been reported on, AT ALL . The letters are public info and u can find them or get certified copies from any of the states for any candidate and chekc this for ytour self. I have seen the actual docs I mailed off for on my own for VA and MD for Obama and Gore. The Gore filing HAD the line, the Obama filing DID NOT.

Given the apparent simplicity of stand-ups, I was quite surprised the first time I saw one that wasn't working. It was immediately obvious to me what was wrong but I realised that it was not obvious to the team. I realised that my team was not aware\u00a0 of the underlying principles and details that would allowed them to diagnose and solve problems with stand-ups. People who have experienced good stand-ups will generally know what can be done when things aren't working well. For novice stand-up attendees, when things go wrong, it is much less likely that they'll figure out what to do. One way to approach this issue is to claim that it's all a matter of tacit knowledge and novices just need to attend more well-run stand-ups. I believe, however, that it's much more likely that given no assistance, novices will simply abandon the practice of daily stand-ups. This would be unfortunate since well-run stand-ups add significant value to projects. This is my attempt to communicate some of the previously tacit knowledge on the benefits and consequences of common practices for daily stand-ups. These patterns of daily stand-up meetings are intended to help new practitioners as well as remind experienced practitioners of what they might already know in their gut.\u00a0 The underlying theme is self-organisation The underlying theme for daily stand-up meetings is self-organisation. This is not just because self-organisation leads to better productivity but also, and perhaps more so, because it leads to a more humane, respectful, and mature work environment. Many of the problems that can arise in executing a good stand-up will derive from a mis-alignment with this underlying motivation of self-organisation. Self-organisation is not a culturally-specific virtue, whether team, organisational, or national culture.\u00a0 If the whole team will not commit to taking responsibility for their own success, the team's performance will be necessarily worse. What is the purpose of the daily stand-up meeting? Summarizing several papers and references ([Anderson, 2002], [Beedle et al., 2000], [Cochango, 2006], [OrgPatternsStandUp], [Rising, 2002], [Rising and Janoff, 2002], [Wells, 1999]) daily stand-ups should achieve the following goals: share commitment communicate daily status, progress, and plans to the team and any observers identify obstacles so that the team can take steps to remove them set direction and focus build a team Share commitment Making daily commitments to each other as a team is the most important goal of daily stand-ups. Sharing commitment is more important than sharing progress or status. This is not to say that an observer will not have a sense of progress and status from the stand-up, but this is secondary to team members publicly committing to each other, and identifying obstacles that prevent them from meeting their commitments. Communicate status The focus of the meetings is on the technical progress in the architecture and the work plan. [OrgPatternsStandUp] Communicating status is not much of a differentiator for stand-ups against any other kind of status meeting. The mechanism\u00a0that stand-ups use for communicating the status, that is the team updates each other instead of a manager, is a differentiator. Updating status every day also ensures that the team reflects on what they're doing at least daily. Identify obstacles When one team member shares an obstacle in the Scrum meeting, the entire team\u2019s resources come together to bear on that problem. Because the team is working together toward a shared goal, every team member must cooperate to reach that goal. The entire team immediately owns any one individual\u2019s problems. [Rising and Janoff, 2000] Raising and removing obstacles earlier allows the team to maintain its momentum. The stand-up itself is not intended to remove any particular obstacle but rather to provide a forum for people to identify obstacles so that other team members have the opportunity to help. Set direction and focus During the daily meetings, the Scrum master would call attention to backlog item priority. This was especially helpful for new team members, who might have gone off in another direction. [Rising and Janoff, 2000] We want everyone to be moving in the same direction. The stand-up is used to continually remind the team what that direction is. Build a team More so than artificial \u201cteam-building\u201d exercises, effective teams are built by regularly communicating, working, and helping each other. This is also strongly tied with team members helping each other with shared obstacles. The team is aware of any particular member's problems because they hear about it every day (until the problem is solved). This environment encourages people to raise problems as a history develops of other people helping when problems are raised. Effective daily stand-ups have a particular feel Technically, the meeting is a \u201cdaily stand-up\u201d if everyone is standing up and the meeting is held every day. However, there is a different feel to a good stand-up that distinguishes it from an empty ritual. An early description of daily stand-up meetings called them Daily Scrums [Beedle et al., 2000] with an intentional association with the rugby term. The energy level of a daily stand-up should perhaps not be quite as high as that of a rugby scrum but it should still feel energising. Quickness and high energy support the goal of setting focus. Long, low-energy meetings tend to distract and mute the day. Good stand-ups will feel supportive. When people are knocked down every time they raise a problem, they will tend to stop raising problems. Beyond preventing removal of obstacles, a non-supportive stand-up works against team dynamics. The stand-up instead becomes a ritual that team members dread [LaPlante, 2003]. When things are going right, there isn't much direction or facilitation required for the stand-up. A good stand-up will feel self-managed. Patterns of daily stand-up meetings Who attends the daily stand-up? All Hands People and representatives from various areas (e.g., marketing, production support, upper management, training, etc.) wish to know about and/or contribute to the status and progress of the project. Communicating status in multiple meetings and reports requires a lot of duplicate effort. Therefore Replace some or all of the meetings and reports with the daily stand-up. Anyone who is directly involved in or wants to know about the day-to-day operation of the project should attend the single daily stand-up meeting. But People not directly involved can disrupt the stand-up. This suggests that another forum would still be required for queries outside the scope of the stand-up. Too many people in the meeting may cause disruption and/or cause people to be uncomfortable in sharing information.\u00a0 Typical daily stand-ups will have at most 10 people.\u00a0 For larger stand-up groups, it is even more important to enforce Pigs and Chickens and Take it Offline in order to ensure all contributers can provide their input in a timely fashion. Not all forms of reporting will be, nor should be, covered by the stand-up format. For example, overall project progress would be better communicated with a Big Visible Chart [Jeffries, 2004] such as burn-down, burn-up, cumulative flow diagram, etc. Pig and Chickens A chicken and a pig are together when the chicken says, \"Let's start a restaurant!\". The pig thinks it over and says, \"What would we call this restaurant?\". The chicken says, \"Ham n' Eggs!\". The pig says, \"No thanks, I'd be committed, but you'd only be involved!\". [Schwaber and Beedle, 2001] During a stand-up, interference by observers causes disruption in the communication within the team. Such interference may be in the form of interruptions or simply by participating and providing inappropriate information. If the interference is severe enough, the team members may not bother using the stand-up to communicate project issues and either create an alternate medium or not communicate at all. Therefore Institute a rule where only the \u201ccommitted\u201d participate and the \u201cinvolved\u201d are only allowed to observe. \u201cCommitted\u201d means any people who contribute to the completion of the current iteration (i.e., developers, testers, immediate managers, etc.). In other words, people who can say something that directly affects the delivery of backlog items/features/stories. \u201cInvolved\u201d are other people who may be interested in the status of the iteration but will not directly contribute to its completion. This could be other managers, sales staff, developers from other projects, etc. Any questions and issues that the \u201cinvolved\u201d have can be resolved after the meeting (Take it Offline) or communicated in a different medium. But Emphasizing too much distinction between the types of meeting attendees risks creating an adversarial relationship. It's not that observers are not allowed to communicate with the team; it is just that such communication is usually inappropriate during the daily stand-up. Attend by Proxy All Team members are required to attend. If for some reason a Team member can't attend in person, the absent member must either attend by telephone or by having another Team member report on their status. [Cochango, 2006] If team members are seen to show up to the stand-up if they feel like it, there is a communication that commitment to the team is not important. However, there are situations when a team member cannot make the meeting for a very legitimate reason (e.g., personal issues, production support problem, etc.). In these case, we still want a way for the member to express commitment in the stand-up. Therefore Team members that cannot attend the stand-up in person should find a way to Attend by Proxy. This can be in the form of a representative, calling in by telephone, or sending an e-mail summary before hand. Virtual attendance is still better than non-attendance. But If team members regularly can't make the stand-up, this may be an indication that the stand-up is being held at a time or location that is not convenient for the whole team. It may also mean that the member is not actually part of the team, whether due to allocation to other responsibilities or problems with team affinity. Of course, attendance by proxy is also inferior to actually attending the meeting in person. What do we talk about during the daily stand-up? Yesterday Today Obstacles Some people are talkative and tend to wander off into Story Telling. Some people want to engage in Problem Solving immediately after hearing a problem. Meetings that take too long tend to have low energy and participants not directly related to a long discussion will tend to be distracted. ` Therefore Structure the contributions using the following format: What did I accomplish yesterday? What will I do today? What obstacles are impeding my progress? \u00a0 These are the minimum number of questions that satisfy the goals of daily stand-ups. Other topics of discussion (e.g., design discussions, gossip, etc.) should be deferred until after the meeting. Lasse Koskela proposed another form of these questions in order to emphasise that team members should not be Reporting to the Leader: Each team member updates his peers: In turn, each team member provides his peers with 3 pieces of information: Things I have done since yesterday's meeting Things I am going to get done today Obstacles that I need someone to remove [Koskela, 2006] If we reconsider this in light of a focus on commitment, the questions might be re-worded as follows: Was I able to fulfill what I committed to? What am I comfortable committing to today? What is obstructing me in meeting my commitments? I prefer this question form for it's clarity though the original form may be simpler. But The structure is not as important as the information the answers to the questions provide. If the information is provided in a less structured protocol, it is not important to stick to a checklist. As teams mature, you may find you want to adjust the structure as well. For example, I tend to add a fourth question: \u201cWhat might help or hinder others in meeting their commitments?\u201d Focus on the Backlog Some people find it difficult to keep the project context in mind when they are contributing. Symptoms of this would be attendees leaving the stand-up without a clear awareness of what remains for the iteration and release, and not much of a direct relationship with issues raised during the stand-up and the progress of the iteration and release. It is much easier to understand project context with a visible reminder. Therefore Remind stand-up attendees to Focus on the Backlog, where a backlog is simply a list of tasks and features to do. For example, maintain an information radiator [Cockburn, 2001] (aka Big Visible Chart) showing the iteration and release status and hold the stand-up near it. The display serves as an obvious reminder of what remains to be done. But Focusing on the backlog may cause a tendency for the stand-up to focus on tasks rather than people. There are always important and subtle people issues that will not be discovered if there is too much focus on task status. Blockage Board Obstacles raised in the stand-up are not removed or otherwise addressed in a timely fashion. Therefore Post raised obstacles to a Blockage Board. This is a publicly visible whiteboard or chart that identifies raised obstacles and tracks the progress of their resolution. A Blockage Board can be updated outside of stand-ups and serves as a more immediate and perhaps less confronting way to initially raise obstacles. A common mistake is to not write large enough to allow people to read the blockages from a distance. The simple act of writing an issue down and therefore explicitly acknowledging it is a very reliable way to reduce drawn out conversations.\u00a0 So even if not everyone agrees that any particular item is an obstacle, it is worth simply writing it down for discussion after the meeting has ended. When and where are the daily stand-ups held? Same Place, Same Time We want the team to have a sense of ownership of the stand-up. We also want interested parties to be able to drop by to observe a stand-up to avoid having to schedule yet another status meeting. This is difficult if any particular team member is allowed to force a delay or change of location of the stand-up. Therefore Run the daily stand-up at the Same Place, Same Time. Do not wait for stragglers, including architects and managers. The meeting is for the whole team, not for any particular individual. This is especially important if you Use the Stand-up to Start the Day. Some stricter teams may impose a \u201cfine\u201d for latecomers. I tend to be wary of any kind of punishment mechanism and prefer discussion. But Same Place, Same Time is not intended to be blindly inflexible. The important thing is for the start time to be mostly consistent and rescheduling to be rare. If rescheduling is required often, it may be an indication that the start time should change. If a particular location is inconvenient for everyone to get to, it's probably an indication the location should change. Use the Stand-up to Start The Day The daily stand-up meeting provides focus and awareness of outstanding issues. If it occurs late in the day, this focus and awareness is wasted. Therefore Use the Stand-up to Start the Day. With flexible work hours, not every team member will arrive at work at the same time. A common practice with \u201cflex-time\u201d is to use a set of core working hours. The start time should be at the start of these core working hours. Similarly, if team members need to arrive later for personal reasons (e.g., need to drop off kids at school), the start time should be set at a time so that everyone can attend. But There is usually a tendency not to work on any project-related tasks until the stand-up. If the Stand-up Meeting Starts the Day... Late, this slack time may be significant. To some extent, this may simply be used as an opportunity to check e-mail, fill in timesheets, etc. but it may be worth investigating removing the stand-up as a \u201cstart of day\u201d ritual by scheduling it later in the day. Don't Use the Stand-up to Start the Day The stand-up tends to serve as the ritual to set focus for the day, especially if you Use The Stand-up to Start the Day. Because of this, team members tend not to work on features until the stand-up. When the meeting is not actually held first thing, this tendency may have a significant impact on productivity. Therefore Don\u2019t Use the Stand-up to Start the Day. Schedule the daily stand-up meeting far enough into the day that it will not be psychologically associated as starting the day. But If the daily meeting doesn't start the day, then it can no longer be used as a shared ritual to set team focus at the start the day. Depending on the team, this price may not be worth the apparent increase in efficiency. When there are many project using stand-ups, it is possible that multiple stand-ups are occurring simultaneously. Observers interested in multiple projects may want to change stand-up times to allow them to be able attend. This is problematic since it risks the sense of ownership for the team if an observer can force a stand-up to adjust to his/her schedule. Nevertheless, this must also be a consideration when deciding when to have the daily stand-up. How do we keep up the energy level of the daily stand-up? Huddle Volume of speech affects attentiveness as well as effectiveness of communication. Physical distance changes the level of volume required to communicate well. Some people don't speak loudly and don't feel comfortable doing so. Therefore The stand-up should be more of a Huddle, than a meeting. If it's difficult to hear, bring everyone closer. Beyond allowing for a more relaxed speaking volume, being physically closer tends to cause participants to be more attentive on their own. Being able to stand physically closer is also an expression of greater trust within the team. If the stand-up is a new thing, it's usually enough to use hand gestures to wave people in and say something to the effect of \u201cLet's bring it in\u201d. If the size of the circle has been established for a while, consider explaining the reasons for closing the circle before trying to shrink it. But The team must balance closeness with personal comfort zones. Even on a very trusting team, there is a point when people are just standing too close for comfort. Symptoms tend to be participants that are tense and/or fidgety. Stand Up Some people are talkative and tend to wander off into Story Telling. Some people want to engage in Problem Solving immediately after hearing a problem. Meetings that take too long tend to have low-energy and participants not directly related to a long discussion will tend to be distracted. Therefore Require that all attendees Stand Up. Use standing up to link physical with mental readiness. Physical discomfort will also remind attendees when a meeting is taking too long. A simple way to encourage this is to simply hold the meeting where there are no chairs. But Standing up tends to cause meetings to shorten, but does not guarantee that they will shorten to an optimal length. People may learn to cope with the discomfort instead of taking a more appropriate response. Also if the meetings are not taking too long nor wandering off-topic, standing up is an unnecessary ritual. Fifteen Minutes or Less Most people will wander mentally when they are in long meetings. A long, droning meeting is a horrible, energy-draining way to start the day. A specific number helps remind us when to consider adjustment to reduce the time of the meeting. Therefore Keep the daily stand-ups to Fifteen Minutes or Less. As a general rule, after fifteen minutes, the average person's mind is going to wander which doesn't help with setting focus. But Fifteen minutes may even be too long for smaller teams. Because of the mind-wandering effect, even for larger teams, fifteen minutes is a good limit.\u00a0 Also, it is also possible to have a meeting that is too short where on ending, the attendees still have no idea what's going on nor who to talk to in order to find out. Signal the End After the last person has spoken, the team may not immediately realise that the meeting is over. The gradual realisation that it's time to walk away doesn't end the meeting on a high note and may contribute to Low Energy. Therefore Signal the End of the stand-up with a throwaway phrase (e.g., \"Well, enjoy your lunch everyone.\" [Gibbs, 2006, Signal]) or some other action. Time the Meetings It is difficult to qualitatively judge whether a stand-up is taking too long, especially if it only gradually increases in length. Therefore Time the Meetings and publish the results. Most of the time, attendees just don't realise the impact of Story Telling, not being prepared to Take It Offline, or not preparing have on how long the meeting will take. Make it quantifiable. But As with all measures, timing the meetings shouldn't be introduced unless there is an actual goal to accomplish due to a problem with energy levels.\u00a0 Once the goal is accomplished, the measurement should be dropped. Measuring for no particular reason leads to suspicion and metrics apathy. Take It Offline Some people want to engage in Problem Solving immediately after hearing a problem. Meetings that take too long tend to have low-energy and participants not directly related to a long discussion will tend to be distracted. It is still important to acknowledge that further discussion will be required to solve the raised problem. Some people may find it uncomfortable to enforce the structure of the stand-up by interrupting. Therefore Use a simple and consistent phrase like \u201cTake it offline\u201d as a reminder that such discussions should take place outside of the daily stand-up. If the discussion was Socialising, nothing more is required. If the discussion was Problem Solving, the facilitator (and eventually just the team) should ensure that the right people are nominated or sign up to deal with the issue later. But There is a difference between Problem Solving and a clarifying question. Information that is not understood is not useful. The extent upon which clarifying questions are allowed should vary depending on how large the team is and whether it will impact Fifteen Minutes or Less. How do we encourage self-managing daily stand-ups? Last Arrival Speaks First During a stand-up, attendees need to know who is supposed to speak first. Having the facilitator decide who should speak first is a subtle though definite force against self-organisation. The team should know without intervention who speaks first. Therefore Agree that the Last Arrival Speaks First. This is a simple rule that also has the added benefit of encouraging people to be punctual about showing up for the stand-up. Round Robin During a stand-up, attendees need to know who is supposed to speak next. Having a facilitator decide who speaks next is a subtle though definite force against self-organisation. The team should know without intervention who speaks next. Therefore Use a simple predetermined rule like a Round Robin to determine who should go next. It doesn't matter if it is clockwise or counter-clockwise. What does matter is that the team runs the meeting, not the facilitator or manager. Pass the Token With simple, predictable ordering mechanisms (e.g., Round Robin), it is very easy for participants to ignore other speakers until it is closer to their turn. There may be a tendency to think of other things rather than pay attention to what others are saying. Therefore Introduce an unpredictable ordering mechanism, like tossing a speaking token (e.g., a ball) to determine who should speak next. Having a speaking token also simplifies deciding who speaks first as it will be the person who happens to have retrieved the token (or the first person s/he tosses the token to). Tossing something around introduces a bit of fun to the daily stand-up ritual and thus serves as a good infection mechanism for other observing teams. I first learned of this pattern on a project I was on with Simon Stewart. We used a small juggling ball but almost anything can be used as token. Other teams have used rugby balls [Gibbs, 2006, Rugby] or even plush toys [Mar, 2006]. But With larger teams, it may become difficult to remember who has already spoken. In those cases, it may be easier to stick to simpler mechanisms like Round Robin. Depending on the culture of the organisation or even team, tossing a ball around may also be seen as unprofessional and would create an unnecessary negative perception of the underlying ritual. Take a Card During a stand-up, attendees need to know who is supposed to speak first and after that, who is supposed to speak next. Having a facilitator decide who should speak is a subtle though definite force against self-organisation. The team is not keen on Pass the Token because they typically have coffee cups in their hands. Therefore Have team member Take a Card that has a number determining the order in which they will speak [Russell, 2006]. Rotate the Facilitator Team members are Reporting to the Leader, that is, they're only talking to the meeting facilitator instead of each other. Only the meeting facilitator is raising and addressing process issues related to the stand-up. We want the team to take ownership of the stand-up and this requires removing any dependence on a single facilitator. Therefore Rotate the Facilitator. Rotate assignment of a role responsible for ensuring people attend the stand-up and stick to the agreed upon rules. But Teams that are not experienced with stand-ups benefit greatly from having a coach experienced in the process. It is more that the team should be weaned into taking greater control of the stand-up. At some point, no explicit facilitator should be required at all. Break Eye Contact Team members are Reporting to the Leader, that is, they're only talking to the meeting facilitator instead of each other. We want the team to take ownership of the stand-up and this requires removing any dependence on a single facilitator. Therefore The facilitator should Break Eye Contact [Nicolette, 2006] as a subtle way of reminding the speaker that s/he should be addressing the team, not just one person. One way to do this is to move around [Shimp, 2006] so that the current speaker can't see the facilitator. Smells are about when things are going wrong I endured regular stand-up meetings for three years. What made the meetings most painful was my boss (I'll call him Wally). His main reason for the stand-up meeting was not to increase efficiency or embrace XP as much as it was to shorten human interaction beyond anything directly related to the work product. ... For Wally, however, the stand-up meeting (like the 7 a.m. Monday meeting and the 5 p.m. Friday meeting) was a loyalty test designed to reinforce the employer-employee relationship. [LaPlante, 2003] The feel of an effective stand-up is about how you know when things are going right. Smells are about how you know when things are going wrong. It is important to note that even if you have no smells, this does not mean the stand-up is going right. It just means that it doesn't \u201cstink\u201d. Most of the following smells are linked back to the previous patterns. For those that are not, the underlying issues tend to be more subtle or outside the scope of the daily stand-up, and people will have to come up with their own solutions. Reporting to the Leader Team members should address the Team. This is not a \"Reporting to the ScrumMaster\" meeting. [Cochango, 2006] Team members are facing and talking to the manager or meeting facilitator instead of to the team. This indicates that the daily stand-up is for the manager/facilitator when it is actually supposed to be for the team. There are various ways to break this dependence: Rotate the Facilitator, Break Eye Contact, change the form of Yesterday Today Obstacles, use Pass the Token, etc. People are Late This is directly addressed by Same Place, Same Time, but as mentioned may indicate that the stand-up is being held at the wrong time or at the wrong place. Stand-up Meeting Starts the Day... Late Because the stand-up is seen to start the work day, no work is done before the stand-up. Depending on how late in the morning the stand-up is, this can have a significant impact on available working hours. This leads to Don't Use the Stand-up to Start the Day. Observers Interrupt Regular interruption by observers is very disruptive to the delivery team by challenging the premise that the daily stand-up is primarily for the delivery team. Interruption also threatens Fifteen Minutes or Less. Enforce Pigs and Chickens. Socialising One of the goals of the stand-up is to increase team socialisation. However, the daily stand-up is not intended for team members to \u201ccatch up\u201d with each other on non project-related matters. It's difficult to provide examples of this since the degree to which socialising passes from team-building to distracting varies from team to team. The threshold can be detected from the behaviours of participants not directly involved in the socialisation. If their energy levels remain high, then it's probably just team-building; if their energy levels drop, then Take It Offline and perhaps provide another forum to act as a Water Cooler [OrgPatternsWaterCooler]. I Can't Remember \u201cWhat did I do yesterday?... I can't remember... What am I doing today?... I dunno...\u201d Daily stand-ups are meetings. Like all meetings, participants have a responsibility to prepare. In this case, all participants are responsible for knowing the answers to Yesterday Obstacles Today. There can be more leniency when it comes to not knowing what will be done today since sometimes there is actually nothing specific planned except picking the next highest priority task off the stack. Lack of preparation causes slower pace which causes lower energy. It also risks failing Fifteen Minutes or Less, which further reduces energy levels. Story Telling Instead of providing a brief description of an issue, the participant provides enough details and context to cause others to tune out. The general rule is to identify obstacles during the stand-up and discuss the details after the stand-up. This can be summarised as \u201cTell the headline, not the whole story\u201d or Take it Offline. Problem Solving The key to keeping the stand-ups Fifteen Minutes or Less is to limit the Story Telling and not succumb to Problem Solving during the meeting. Take it Offline. Low Energy Could indicate a slow-down of pace due to Story Telling, Problem Solving, etc. In which case Take it Offline. Could be simply a matter of team size. Could be the time of day which suggests trying the alternative of Use the Stand-up to Start the Day and Don't Use the Stand-up to Start the Day. Obstacles are not Raised There may be several reasons for obstacles not being raised. Not remembering, high pain threshold, lack of trust in raising issues (because Obstacles are not Removed, Observers Interrupt with blaming), etc. Depending on the context, just introducing Yesterday Obstacles Today and enforcing Pigs and Chickens may not be enough. Introducing a Blockage Board may provide a less confronting medium to raise obstacles. Retrospectives [Kerth, 2001] are an effective way of discovering the underlying reason why Obstacles are not Raised. Obstacles are not Removed With the exception of a blaming environment, the surest way to stop people from raising obstacles is to not remove them. To make it difficult to forget and/or ignore obstacles, track them publicly with a Blockage Board. Obstacles are Only Raised in the Stand-up Stand-ups act as a safety net. At worst, an obstacle will be communicated to the greater team within one day. However, doing stand-ups is not intended to stop issues from being raised and resolved during the day. Introducing an alternative medium to raise obstacles such as a Blockage Board may help. If not, underlying reasons may be discovered using retrospectives. If the feel is good, you're probably okay Hopefully this paper has provided some more insight into the subtle details of effective stand-up practices and also common problem indicators. It should be clear that a daily stand-up is not just standing up together every day. It is important not to be too concerned about not having every pattern or even having some of the smells. If all the goals are satisfied and the \u201cfeel\u201d is good, you're probably okay. After all, it's really just standing up together every day. What are other people saying? As far as I know, there are no other low-level patterns papers on daily stand-ups though the core ideas exist in the referenced papers. There are a couple online articles on daily stand-up anti-patterns or smells ([Miller, 2003], [Cohn, 2003]) though both are limited in scope.

Mobile users polled by Keynote Systems for Adobe reported a preference for mobile browsers to access virtually all mobile content. Games, music and social media were the only categories in which users would rather use a downloaded app than browse the mobile web. Their preference for mobile browsers extended to the retail category, with users showing a strong bias toward mobile browsers for accomplishing every mobile shopping task mentioned. Whether it was researching product and price info or sharing that information socially, mobile users would rather fire up a browser than a dedicated app. These preferences may surprise mobile experts who consider apps to offer the best content and shopping experiences. And marketers may be frustrated as well; getting an app on a user\u2019s home screen is a constant reminder of the brand, but it doesn\u2019t make sense to offer an app users don\u2019t want. Consumers may simply be unimpressed by the mobile-optimized efforts they have seen so far. When the Adobe survey asked about a preference for using regular or mobile-optimized websites on their mobile device, they preferred regular sites in both the consumer products-shopping and media-entertainment categories. According to the report, this preference suggests \u201ca low awareness of optimized experiences for the mobile web,\u201d but users could also be frustrated with the limited functionality many mobile-optimized sites provide.

The reptile house closed immediately after her escape, and zookeepers are saying she could take weeks to come out of hiding. While we can't vouch for the authenticity of the snake taking Manhattan, you can follow her adventures on Twitter, where @bronxzooscobra has been chronicling the travels of the errant snake with over 25,000 followers and counting. So where does a young snakess on the town go? She first mused over a Broadway show, then taunted followers with her location in front of \"the original\" Ray's Pizza (good luck checking all 46 locations claiming to be the first). After taking in the other wildlife at American Museum of Natural His(s)tory, she went downtown for a workout at Equinox Gym and a slither atop the High Line park. The Bronx Zoo cobra then tweeted about getting tickets for Jimmy Fallon before spotting Tina Fey at Rockefeller Center and heading back downtown to Wall Street. Despite asking for a vegan restaurant near Union Square, she ended up way uptown at Tom's Restaurant from Seinfeld, where she may have found a hiding spot for the night in an unsuspecting apartment. Where will she go today? Any New York travel tips for the cobress? Have you spotted any snakes, tweeting or just taking in the sights? While she is just 20 inches long, she is venomous, so watch your ankles!SourceEmail thisTweet this!Facebook Leave a commentDaily gear deals: $3 USB travel hub, $79 Casio digital camera and moreby Scott Carmichael (RSS feed) on Mar 29th, 2011 at 10:30AM Here are Gadling's hottest daily gear deals for today, Tuesday March 29, 2011.

A trio of Bahamian men readies it for a day of spearfishing along the near-reef that parallels the 110-mile long island. One will drive; another will watch and stack fish. The third \u2013 a lithe, fair-skinned black man with 'Aries' tattooed on his upper arm, who dons a thick wetsuit while we talk \u2013 will dive and spear. They hope the day's catch will include as many as 40 grouper, maybe another 40 lobster. The laws for all fishermen in the Bahamas are pretty straightforward, no matter the size of the boat or crew: Boats must be 100 percent owned by Bahamians. They can use seine nets, hook and line or -- 'Aries' tool of choice this morning -- the Hawaiian sling and spear. There can be no long lines, no chemicals or explosives in the Bahamas. The small fishermen have no GPS or fish finders. Bigger boats, mostly based at the north end of the island, have set up what the locals refer to as \"condominiums,\" slatted wooden traps to catch lobsters. The day will take this trio 30 miles down the coast and back and will end by early afternoon, when they will take whatever they've caught across the island to the port at Governor's Harbor where they will clean and hawk it from the boat ramp. The cutting table there is close enough to the road that passing drivers can slow, observe, ask questions (\"What you got today?\" \"How fresh?\") And decide to stop and buy ... or not.Read more \u2192Email thisTweet this!<a name=\"fb_share\" type=\"icon_link\" share_url=\"http://www.gadling.com/2011/03/29/eleuthera-island-bahamas-fishing-is-a-good-life-here/\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.gadling.com/2011/03/29/eleuthera-island-bahamas-fishing-is-a-good-life-here/&t=Eleuthera Island, Bahamas - \"Fishing is a Good Life Here\"\">Facebook Leave a commentHarla: Ethiopia's lost civilizationby Sean McLachlan (RSS feed) on Mar 29th, 2011 at 9:30AM Eastern Ethiopia's history is shrouded in mystery. Most archaeologists investigate early hominids like Lucy, the famous Australopithecus afarensis, or study the great civilizations of the north like Gondar and Axum. The east, though, is virtually unknown, and only enigmatic ruins and strange legends remain. Scattered around eastern Ethiopia all the way to Somaliland and the Red Sea are the ruins of towns with large stone buildings unlike anything made by the modern Oromo and Somali peoples. These are the remnants of the little-known Harla civilization. Wanting to learn more, I contacted archaeologist, author, and Harar tour guide Muhammed Jami Guleid (guleidhr @yahoo.com). \"Dake\", as everybody here calls him, helped me travel to Somaliland last year and is an invaluable resource for local culture and history. He knows everybody and he's excavated Harla graves in Ethiopia's Somali region and in Somaliland. They were a race of giants, people say, and immensely strong. They'd perform amazing feats of strength like playing with balls made from the entire hide of a goat. A schoolkid we gave a lift to told us the Harla were three meters tall! This rumor probably came about because of their unusual graves. They're long and thin, sometimes three or four meters long, although the skeletons in them aren't unusually tall. The graves are usually covered with a layer of ash (probably from burnt offerings), the skeleton of a sacrificed cow, and below that a stone slab sealing the tomb.

Rather than stay home or cancel travel plans, many travelers are looking at train or bus transportation or cruise vacations at a port they can drive to rather than flying. Amtrak reports business is good. February marked 16 consecutive months of ridership growth and was the best February on record with 1,099,010 passengers. \"The ridership increase shows the continued popularity of rail travel and the need for continued investment in passenger rail service\" said Amtrak President and CEO Joe Boardman. Instead of booking a flight, standing in security lines at the airport, running to catch a connecting flight, then getting to the hotel at their destination, a growing number of travelers are choosing a cruise vacation. The all-inclusive nature of a cruise combined with easy access by car, rail or bus to local home-ports spread around the U.S. is allowing travelers to skip the airport, hotel and/or rental car altogether.Read more \u2192SourceEmail thisTweet this!Facebook Leave a commentEnter the Put Foot Rally for an African road trip adventureby Kraig Becker (RSS feed) on Mar 29th, 2011 at 8:00AMAdventurous travelers looking for a unique road trip this summer may want to checkout the Put Foot Rally, which is scheduled to get underway in June. The event begins in South Africa and promises to send teams on a 7000km (4350 mile) long odyssey through the wilds of Africa. The 17-day rally will kick off at two separate starting lines, one in Cape Town and the other in Johannesburg. Once underway, competitors will navigate on their own, and are free to take any path they like, but are required to reach certain checkpoints along the way by certain times. For instance, the first checkpoint is located at the Andersson Gate, just outside Etosha Park in Namibia. How you manage to find your way to that destination is entirely up to you, but you'll certainly want to get there on time, as each of the checkpoints will play host to a party as well. Subsequent CP's will be located on the Okavango Delta in Botwsana, in Livingstone, Zambia, and on the edge of Lake Malawi in Malawi. From there it is on to Inhambane in Mozambique before proceeding on to the finish line in Swaziland. All told, counting the starting and finish line, there are seven checkpoints, and seven parties, in all. The Put Foot is accepting just 50 crews for the inaugural 2011 rally, and as of this writing they are about halfway to filling that quota. A crew can consist of as many people as you want, but they all have to fit inside one vehicle. Speaking of which, you can also drive any type of car, truck, or SUV you want, as long as it gets you to the checkpoints on time. You can even elect to ride on a motorcycle if you prefer. Organizers of the rally estimate that about 95% of the route can be done on paved roads, which means a 4x4 isn't necessary to compete. But part of the fun will no doubt be getting off the beaten path and finding interesting ways to reach the checkpoints. Just don't take a wrong turn and end up in a country you weren't expecting!

Whether you're on a schooner, a yacht or a cruise ship, being on a boat makes you cooler. However, no form of transportation is perfect. Cars break down, planes crash and boats...well, there's apparently more that can go wrong with boats than we ever could have imagined. So, if you have four minutes to kill and want to see boat after boat meet a horrible fate, then this is the video for you. Of course, we never root for disasters and we hope that everyone walked (or swam) away safely. That said, we'll be laughing our way to the life boats and making sure that we have a floatation device handy at all times.

Study the Torah. Read the Torah. Give a report about the Torah. Something along those lines. Kinda boring but part of the deal. It was the after-party that got all the press. Now, things are changing as families look for new ways to celebrate one of the Jewish faith's most treasured events, the Bar Mitzvah. First, quick, loose lesson on the Jewish faith. When a boy \"comes of age\" at 13 he has become a \"bar mitzvah\" and Jewish tradition holds that he now has the same rights and responsibilities as a full grown man. The people that give out drivers licenses, voter registration cards and the like (including the sellers of beer, believe me) disagree but as Jews we're used to the whole opression thing so we move along. Bar mitzvah also refers to the religious ceremony that goes along with a boy becoming a Bar Mitzvah and the party will follow the ceremony and that party is also called a bar mitzvah. Bat Mitzvah is the girl version which is basically the same deal but for girls it's age 12 (because \"girls are better than boys\" as my mother told me countless times) Got it? Ok let's move along then.Read more \u2192SourceEmail thisTweet this!Facebook1 CommentWhisky Live returns, bringing the world's best whisky event to even more cities worldwideby McLean Robbins (RSS feed) on Mar 28th, 2011 at 4:30PM Whisky lovers, rejoice.

Stories of a giant cloud of nuclear waste on the way to cripple the United States and an e-mail predicting acid rain turned out to be a hoax. It is almost business-as-usual for travelers, with a few exceptions to be aware of.Read more \u2192SourceEmail thisTweet this!Facebook2 CommentsNext Page \u2192 Gadling Features 100 words or less tips Next TipPrevious Tip Hotel TipsBring an over-the-door shoe organizer - Hotel tipCheck the alarm upon arrival - Hotel tipBring an A/V cable for your laptop - Hotel tipGood hotel coffee starts with ice - Hotel tipCarry a door stop - Hotel tip Dining Out Tips Look where cab drivers eat - Dining out tipObserve other diners - Dining out tipRole play at dinner - Dining out tipAsk your social network - Dining out tipExploring a city via pub crawl - Dining out tip Cruise Tips Arrive a day early - Cruise tip Hide your valuables in a tackle box - Cruise tip Travel mugs are indispensable at sea - Cruise tip Avoid \"white space\" in cruise travel - Cruise tip Find your door easily on a cruise ship - Cruise tip Airplane Tips Don't take sleep aids until you're in the air - Airplane tipSwap shelves in airport bookstores - Airplane tipWear sunglasses during the flight - Airplane tipMaking multiple stops?

Check out our list of non-traditional sports and activities to get the blood pumping. 1. Canyoneering Wind, climb, rappel, and crawl through the contours and formations carved by flash floods and rivers racing through canyons. Canyoneering is the adventurous sport of traversing narrow canyons that have been sculpted by water. Canyons vary in their depth, width, and difficulty. A wide range of canyoneering routes are found throughout the world from simple/non-technical walk in the park types hikes to extremely difficult routes requiring technical swimming, rappels, and ropework. 2. Fastpacking Cut out weight, kick up the speed and travel far and fast into the wilderness. Fastpacking is ultralight backpacking combining trail running and hiking to propel hikers further and deeper into the wilderness. Fastpackers can travel upwards to 30 miles a day with their ultralight packs, simple shelters, and minimalist food supplies. Without such modern day distractions like deluxe multi-tools and a handheld GPS, fastpacking is a way to get more immersed in the terrain and the experience of moving through it.. 3. Four Square Grab some sidewalk chalk and a rubber playground ball and you are good to go. Four square has moved off the playground and into the driveways of hip twenty and thirty-somethings across the US and Canada. A court is drawn up with four squares of equal size and each square occupies a single player. The player in the top spot serves the ball into any other player\u2019s square and play continues until someone misses the ball or messes up and that person is eliminated allowing everyone to move up a square and get closer to the highly coveted \u201cKing\u201d spot. 4. Geocaching Search high and low for hidden treasures in this huge global game of hide and seek. Geocachers use a GPS to find treasure stashes anywhere in the World. Geocaches are usually waterproof containers that contain a logbook and some trade items that a geocacher hid and then logged the GPS coordinates online for other geocachers to find. Geocaches have varying difficult levels from simple drive-ups to more complex searches requiring long off-road drives, scaling mountain peaks, or underwater dives. Geocaches are even found in such far-flung destinations as Antarctica and north of the Arctic Circle. 5. Packrafting Backcountry exploration is often limited by water crossings\u2013creeks, rivers, wetlands, or lakes that because of temperature and other factors, are impassable with out some kind of boat. Packrafts are lightweight, portable boats compact enough to be carried during treks through backcountry terrain. Along with collapsible paddles and safety equipment, packrafting gear weighs last than nine pounds and fits into your backpack right alongside other backcountry equipment. 6. Bike polo Construct a homemade mallet with PVC pipe, a ski pole, and hockey tape and head out to your local parking garage for a game of urban bike polo. Played in parking garages, basketball courts, or any other urban concrete slab urbanites can find teams of bikers use mallets to strike a ball into a goal. In contrast to the mellower version of bike polo played in the grass, urban bike polo often results in plenty of crashes and carnage. As far as rules go bike polo has more in common with hockey than the traditional horse-riding polo. The game begins with a ball placed in the middle of the court and each team waits behind their goal and then charges the ball when the game is called to a start. The game continues until a team reaches a preset number of goals or reached a time limit. 7. Parkour Flip, jump, and vault your way over walls, fences, and other urban obstacles. Parkour is actually a philosophy of movement in addition to a sport \u2013 think urban gymnastics meets humanistic theory. The object of parkour is to get from one place to another in the most efficient way possible using only the body and other objects in the environment. Parkour is about overcoming mental barriers as well as physical barrier and parkour strongly discourages competition, reckless behavior, and risky stunts. 8. Longboarding Carve down paved hills on a snowboard with wheels. Longboarding is just downhill skateboarding with a longer and wider board. There are no freestyle moves, aerials, or flip tricks in longboarding, it is all about cruising from one place to another with smooth fluid movements creating that feeling of snowboarding or surfing. 9. Extreme Croquet Drive croquet balls through weeds, rivers, sand, and mud. Extreme croquet in contrast to the regular backyard variety is an anything-goes version of croquet where there are no boundaries to the playing area, a number of unique and interesting challenges, and ridiculous house rules or no rules at all. 10. Stand-up Paddling Paddle through flat water and into waves while standing up on a super long surfboard. Stand-up paddle surfing is an old school Hawaiian sport originating in the 1940s when Waikiki beach boys would paddle out on their longboards to take pictures of the tourists on shore. Since then stand-up paddling has exploded in popularity because of its quick learning curve and simple nature \u2013 most people are up and paddling within 30 minutes of learning. source 10 Non-Traditional Sports To Get You Outdoors Save And Share : online marketing 0 comments Post a Comment Older Post Home Popular Posts The Brutal Training to Become a Shaolin Monk One man hauls up two ropes and hooks them under either arm as suddenly their tautness threatens to split him in two.

Essa efetividade n\u00e3o \u00e9 \u00fanica e o cinema v\u00ea um novo bom momento para produ\u00e7\u00f5es mais enxutas e com grande qualidade. O Brainstorm9 entrevistou Boyle e seu atual escudeiro fiel, o produtor Christian Colson, para entender esse processo. Antes de se falar em Danny Boyle, \u00e9 preciso citar cinco filmes obrigat\u00f3rios de sua filmografia: \u201cTrainspotting\u201d, \u201cExterm\u00ednio\u201d, \u201cSunshine \u2013 Alerta Solar\u201d, \u201cQuem Quer Ser Um Milion\u00e1rio?\u201d e \u201c127 Horas\u201d. Pois bem, apresenta\u00e7\u00f5es feitas, hora de entender a fun\u00e7\u00e3o desse ingl\u00eas baixinho, bem-humorado e simp\u00e1tico no cinema atual. Embora n\u00e3o seja o \u00fanico [Darren Aronofsky se encaixa no mesmo perfil, por exemplo], Boyle faz algo quase alien\u00edgena quando o assunto \u00e9 cinema de sucesso: filmes baratos com lucros astron\u00f4micos. Ou seja, ele gasta pouco, realiza muito e marca presen\u00e7a sem gastar mais de US$ 20 milh\u00f5es, valor considerado m\u00e9dio pelos padr\u00f5es hollywoodianos. O exemplo mais recente \u00e9 \u201c127 Horas\u201d, indicado ao Oscar de Melhor Filme na \u00faltima edi\u00e7\u00e3o do pr\u00eamio. \u201cN\u00e3o sei viver com essa din\u00e2mica dos grandes est\u00fadios\u201d, declara Danny Boyle, em visita a Los Angeles, quando nos concedeu essa entrevista exclusiva. \u201cPerde-se muito tempo com reuni\u00f5es demoradas, normalmente inconclusivas, com gente que nunca fez um filme por conta pr\u00f3pria tentando te dizer o que vai funcionar ou n\u00e3o. Admiro gente como James Cameron, que consegue manter sua individualidade em meio a tudo isso\u201d. A porrada pode ser direcionada ao curioso momento em que Boyle recusou a dire\u00e7\u00e3o de \u201cAlien: A Ressurrei\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d, que acabou ficando nas m\u00e3os do franc\u00eas Jean-Pierre Jeunet. A postura de Boyle n\u00e3o \u00e9 arrogante, pelo contr\u00e1rio, pois refor\u00e7a seu pr\u00f3prio aprendizado e sistema de trabalho, que costuma funcionar bem. Danny Boyle no set de 127 Horas \u00c9 tudo fruto de um processo criativo bem definido e enraizado no estilo de Boyle, que trabalha de forma praticamente independente, com base em Londres. \u201cN\u00e3o ter tantos investidores norte-americanos permite muita liberdade, pois a maioria deles confia nas decis\u00f5es de Danny e no tipo de filme que costumamos produzir\u201d, defende o produtor Christian Colson, nascido na Argentina, mas radicado na Inglaterra. \u201cN\u00e3o reclamaria de receber US$ 200 milh\u00f5es de investimento, mas acho que n\u00e3o saber\u00edamos o que fazer com tanto dinheiro\u201d, brinca. \u201cEstamos habituados a apostar em criatividade e, n\u00e3o necessariamente, em processos caros. Danny pensa assim e a\u00ed de mim se tentar dizer o contr\u00e1rio!\u201d. A descontra\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 fruto de confian\u00e7a m\u00fatua e a inequ\u00edvoca sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de que dupla Boyle-Colson [forjada no calor da batalha para \"Quem Quer Ser Um Milion\u00e1rio?\"] funciona perfeitamente, durante a produ\u00e7\u00e3o ou durante os eventos de divulga\u00e7\u00e3o. Uma amizade nasceu ali e o que cada um fala, em suas respectivas \u00e1reas, \u00e9 lei. Danny Boyle e Christian Colson recebem o Oscar de Melhor Filme por Slumdog Millionaire \u201cTamb\u00e9m ajuda o fato de eu conseguir as coisas das quais precisamos, ent\u00e3o j\u00e1 viu\u201d, descontra\u00ed. \u201cEspecialmente quando podemos pegar a verba da Inglaterra e vir filmar nos Estados Unidos, como foi o caso de 127 Horas. \u00c9 bom mudar os ares\u201d. Esse formato de produ\u00e7\u00e3o se torna bem interessante pelo aspecto criativo, veja o processo resumido: 1. Cria\u00e7\u00e3o/Conceito de Boyle [Colson j\u00e1 come\u00e7a a or\u00e7ar e captar] 2. Dupla de cria\u00e7\u00e3o para roteiro com Boyle e roteirista, no caso de \u201cQuem Quer Ser Um Milion\u00e1rio?\u201d e \u201c127 Horas\u201d, Simon Beaufoy. [Colson j\u00e1 tem o or\u00e7amento estimado decupado] 3. Vers\u00e3o final: Boyle-Colson (j\u00e1 com or\u00e7amento captado) definem o cronograma e demandas de produ\u00e7\u00e3o. \u00c9 simples e \u00e9 exatamente disso que Danny Boyle gosta. Fosse um filme de est\u00fadio, esse programa de 3 passos seria imenso, com reuni\u00f5es, aprova\u00e7\u00f5es, idas e vindas de or\u00e7amentos, mudan\u00e7as de direcionamento e etc. \u201cSinto muito prazer em pegar um filme pequeno, inserir cenas mais grandiosas ou elementos de a\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00edpicos de produ\u00e7\u00f5es caras e chegar no mesmo resultado\u201d, explica. \u201cCada diretor faz do jeito que se sente mais confort\u00e1vel e seguro. N\u00e3o h\u00e1 certo e errado. Esse sistema funciona para mim, digamos, \u00e9 minha identidade\u201d. Identidade \u00e9 a chave no cinema atual. Com Zack Snyder elevando \u00e0 en\u00e9sima pot\u00eancia a proposta visual de Baz Luhrmann na d\u00e9cada passada, a resposta do cinema autoral vem forte com Aronofsky, Boyle, Tom Hooper e, na escala das superprodu\u00e7\u00f5es, J.J. Abrams. S\u00e3o diretores mostrando trabalho e muita certeza de suas decis\u00f5es para relembrar uma ind\u00fastria atualmente motivada por remakes e adapta\u00e7\u00f5es desnecess\u00e1rias, da for\u00e7a de seus contadores de hist\u00f3rias e vision\u00e1rios dram\u00e1ticos. A linha de pensamento de Boyle funciona por conta de bom senso nas escolhas que facilitam o investimento menor (como, por exemplo, aproveitar a estrutura de Bollywood para filmar \u201cQuem Quer Ser Um Milion\u00e1rio?\u201d; ou recriar parte do cen\u00e1rio de \u201c127 Horas\u201d em est\u00fadio para reduzir os alt\u00edssimos custos de loca\u00e7\u00f5es) e um comprometimento com o tipo de hist\u00f3ria que ele gosta de contar. \u201c\u00c9 mais complexo olhar para um dilema em grupo. A solu\u00e7\u00e3o mais f\u00e1cil \u00e9 pensar em termos de her\u00f3i; uma din\u00e2mica mais f\u00e1cil de criar. E \u00e9 muito mais dif\u00edcil escrever assim. Shakespeare n\u00e3o escrevia trabalhos de grupo, Tchekhov sim. Mas, no fim das contas, ningu\u00e9m \u00e9 realmente solit\u00e1rio. Encontramos companhia nas mais diversas situa\u00e7\u00f5es, seja se consolar ao compreender que outros passaram pelo seu mesmo desafio ou se agarrar \u00e0 mais improv\u00e1vel das possibilidades. Fazer isso \u00e9 arriscado, mas riscos s\u00e3o necess\u00e1rios para, efetivamente, criar algo\u201d. \u00a0 Comente F\u00e1bio M.

E nessa semana, como muitos de voc\u00eas souberam, o caso foi de O Botic\u00e1rio. As primeiras perguntas que fa\u00e7o s\u00e3o: a mudan\u00e7a era realmente necess\u00e1ria? Isso veio de uma id\u00e9ia ou de uma necessidade? Apontada pelo cliente, pela ag\u00eancia de publicidade ou por um escrit\u00f3rio de design? Particularmente, sou defensor da vitalidade das marcas (bem constru\u00eddas). E temos bons exemplos disso: a American Airlines (do Vignelli) e a Fedex (da Landor) s\u00e3o cl\u00e1ssicos do design neste aspecto. Que comportam de maneira eficiente (e perene) o esp\u00edrito das empresas, sustentados pela forma. No final das contas, evolu\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o bem-vindas? Claro que sim. Mas nem sempre s\u00e3o necess\u00e1rias. Voltando ao caso\u2026 ontem e hoje, a maior parte das cr\u00edticas que li, apontavam para o acento do \u201c\u00e1\u201d. Realmente, tem um aspecto diferente (resolveram o acento aplicando uma personalidade de ascendente). Mas honestamente, n\u00e3o ligo tanto assim para isto (p\u00ealo em ovo, vai!). Impress\u00e3o particular: O Botic\u00e1rio \u00e9 uma marca sensorial. Quando penso nesta palavra (esque\u00e7a a empresa, pense apenas no teor de \u201cbotic\u00e1rio\u201d) me vem na mente algo delicado e suave. Como se estivesse em um pequeno atelier, com uma simp\u00e1tica vendedora, que me mostra cada fragr\u00e2ncia e me ajuda a perceber a sensibilidade e o aroma de cada produto. E adoro esse sentimento. Sinto que ainda n\u00e3o encontrei isto na nova paleta de cores (quero v\u00ea-las pessoalmente). At\u00e9 aqui ela me parece linda. Moderna, vibrante e feminina. Mas vendo as sacolas, tenho a impress\u00e3o de que dentro tem um t\u00eanis ou um secador de cabelos. N\u00e3o uma ess\u00eancia de banho que quero dar de presente. Mas verdade seja dita: as embalagens (ao menos as duas publicadas) est\u00e3o bonitas. Outro ponto \u00e9 aquela linda bossa atr\u00e1s do \u201cB\u201d. \u00c9 bel\u00edssima de se ver em uma propor\u00e7\u00e3o mediana. Mas n\u00e3o consigo imaginar como ficaria, por exemplo, aplicada em um tubo de batom. Pequena demais? Fina demais? Impercept\u00edvel demais? O que tamb\u00e9m me deixa curioso sobre o estudo de packing. Testaram isto nas \u201csei l\u00e1 quantas 2.000 embalagens\u201d da empresa? No geral, a estrutura\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1 elegante. Um tipografia legal, com um movimento bacana e um kerning adequado. Tem personalidade. Mas ainda assim, n\u00e3o consigo encontrar a ess\u00eancia de banho que quero dar para a minha mulher. O que me deixa com uma \u00faltima pulga atr\u00e1s da orelha: com tudo isto, quem \u00e9 o novo target de O Botic\u00e1rio? \u00a0 Comente Saulo Mileti saulo@mileti.com.br @saulomileti Tags: americanairlines, Fedex, logo, Marca, oboticario, redesign Posts Relacionados: B9 pergunta: Porque a nova marca de O Botic\u00e1rio \u00e9 assim?

Al\u00e9m disso, estreia no pr\u00f3ximo domingo \u2013 intervalo do Fant\u00e1stico \u2013 uma campanha com a assinatura: \u201cO Botic\u00e1rio. A vida \u00e9 bonita, mas pode ser linda.\u201d Assim como a maioria dos coment\u00e1rios no Twitter \u2013 mesmo como um leigo \u2013 eu estava prestes a espinafrar o redesign nesse post, muito por causa da estranha combina\u00e7\u00e3o de cores publicadas em diversos sites, e j\u00e1 imaginava que o mesmo aconteceria nos coment\u00e1rios pelos leitores \u2013 bem como em quase todos os posts recentes sobre rebranding. Por\u00e9m, ao inv\u00e9s de suposi\u00e7\u00f5es e achismos, nada melhor do que conversar com quem coordenou todo esse processo de mudan\u00e7a para perguntar o que, afinal, eles estavam pensando. Abaixo, algumas respostas dadas ao Brainstorm9 pela Katya Hochleiner, Gerente Executiva de Marketing de O Botic\u00e1rio, al\u00e9m de alguns exemplos de aplica\u00e7\u00e3o da marca que ela nos mostrou. B9: Katya, recentemente temos publicado v\u00e1rias mudan\u00e7as de marcas no Brainstorm9, e quase sempre elas apanham dos leitores, sejam eles leigos ou experts, sejam com explica\u00e7\u00f5es t\u00e9cnicas ou puramente por gosto pessoal. E pelos coment\u00e1rios que tenho acompanhado no Twitter, o redesign de O Botic\u00e1rio parece ir pelo mesmo caminho. Sendo assim, voc\u00ea poderia nos explicar \u2013 fugindo da generalidade dos press releases \u2013 o que esse novo logo pretende transmitir aos consumidores? Katya Hochleiner: A logomarca quer transmitir beleza, alegria e sofistica\u00e7\u00e3o acess\u00edvel. A logomarca anterior n\u00e3o entregava isso, e trouxemos evolu\u00e7\u00e3o / modernidade / organicidade /conforto atrav\u00e9s das letras, mantendo um p\u00e9 na tradi\u00e7\u00e3o, que \u00e9 representada pelo monograma ( a letra B com os \u201cflorais\u201d, que s\u00e3o as linhas sinuosas, em linguagem de caligrafia \u2013 que traz em sua origem grega o significado de escrever com beleza). As varia\u00e7\u00f5es de cores trazem alegria. Al\u00e9m disso, \u00e9 importante notar, se diferencia de uma s\u00e9rie de followers que surgiram no mercado. B9: Vi at\u00e9 agora alguns poucos exemplos de utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de cores com a marca, e achei a mistura um pouco gritante, inc\u00f4moda aos olhos. Qual foi o crit\u00e9rio para escolha dessas cores? Como \u00e9 a paleta? E voc\u00ea poderia exemplificar ou mostrar aplica\u00e7\u00f5es (produtos, loja, an\u00fancio\u2026)? Existem v\u00e1rias combina\u00e7\u00e3o de cores, conversando com os diversos p\u00fablicos de nossas linhas. Levou em conta as cores que est\u00e3o nas cole\u00e7\u00f5es de cores da moda com mais freq\u00fc\u00eancia nos \u00faltimos 3 anos, mas que tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o apontadas como as mais fortes para se manter no futuro. Foi desenvolvido um brand book com v\u00e1rias possibilidades de contraste entre as cores, mas o resultado final \u00e9 sempre alegre e quente. N\u00f3s dizemos que \u00e9 uma logomarca \u201cno color\u201d. B9: Tendo em vista que a nova marca possui detalhes t\u00e3o delicados, como foi o estudo de aplica\u00e7\u00e3o nas t\u00e3o variadas embalagens de O Botic\u00e1rio. Existiu um planejamento minucioso para essas redu\u00e7\u00f5es, aplica\u00e7\u00f5es impressas e digitais? Foram feitos v\u00e1rios testes de aplica\u00e7\u00e3o por tipo de material e tamanho. A logomarca tem uma forma principal , que chamamos de integrada, e mais tr\u00eas outras que tamb\u00e9m podem ser usadas, para se adaptar a situa\u00e7\u00f5es mais complicadas, em produtos muito pequenos, por exemplo. Nossa logomarca ganhou movimento. B9: Na repercuss\u00e3o sobre o novo logo do Chrome, o navegador do Google, surgiu uma quest\u00e3o \u2013 pelos leitores Lucas e Michell Lott \u2013 de que o design n\u00e3o \u00e9 feito para o p\u00fablico especialista em comunica\u00e7\u00e3o, e sim para o leigo, e que s\u00e3o essas mudan\u00e7as ousadas que ditar\u00e3o o que o leigo vai gostar no futuro. Voc\u00ea concorda com isso? No caso de O Botic\u00e1rio a mudan\u00e7a foi feita tendo em vista nossos clientes, nossa vis\u00e3o de futuro e foi com eles que a nova logo foi testada em pesquisa. Em geral a nova logo foi adorada pelas consumidoras de nossos produtos e clientes das nossas lojas, elas diziam que esta logo trazia para O Botic\u00e1rio um valor que elas n\u00e3o viam no logo anterior. \u00a0 Comente Carlos Merigo carlosmerigo@gmail.com @cmerigo Tags: botic\u00e1rio, Cosm\u00e9ticos, entrevista, futurebrand, logo, Marca, rebranding, redesign Posts Relacionados: O Botic\u00e1rio: \u00c9 necess\u00e1rio mudar?

In this post we\u2019ll use similar techniques to create a variety of ribbons.Ribbon effects are in vogue. Most designers use positioned images, but we\u2019ll create them without using border effects and a single h2 tag: <h2>My Heading</h2> Let\u2019s give this a little style and make it overlap the containing element: /* containing element */ #page { width: 500px; padding: 50px; margin: 0 auto; background-color: #fff; border: 1px solid #333; } h2 { position: relative; width: 50%; font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold; padding: 6px 20px 6px 70px; margin: 30px 10px 10px -70px; color: #555; background-color: #999; text-shadow: 0px 1px 2px #bbb; -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 2px 4px #888; -moz-box-shadow: 0px 2px 4px #888; box-shadow: 0px 2px 4px #888; } In this example, our #page has 50px of padding and a 1px border. The heading has a left margin of -71px so it overlaps the edge by 20px. Note we\u2019re also using position: relative so the other ribbon elements can be positioned as necessary.Now we need to create the folded part of the ribbon which goes \u2018behind\u2019 the page. As we saw in the last post, we can use border effects to create any type of triangular shape on an :after pseudo-element with zero width and height: h2:after { content: ' '; position: absolute; width: 0; height: 0; left: 0px; top: 100%; border-width: 5px 10px; border-style: solid; border-color: #666 #666 transparent transparent; } It\u2019s looking great and that might be all you need. But client\u2019s love over-designed pages so let\u2019s take it a little further. First, we could apply a flag shape to the right-hand edge by overlaying a white triangle applied to the :before pseudo-element: h2:before { content: ' '; position: absolute; width: 0; height: 0; right: -2px; top: 0px; border-color: transparent #fff transparent transparent; } That\u2019s nice, but what about a folded-back ribbon effect on the left-hand edge? No problem: h2:before { content: ' '; position: absolute; width: 30px; height: 0; left: -30px; top: 12px; border-width: 20px 10px; border-style: solid; border-color: #999 #999 #999 transparent; } The border color of the pseudo-elements much match the background color of the h2 since it actually appears above the title. Altering the z-index doesn\u2019t work on pseudo-elements if the parent is positioned.Please see the demonstration page for an example which shows all three ribbon styles. It works as expected in IE8, IE9, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera. IE6 and IE7 degrade gracefully and show the main overlapping title. All the CSS code is contained in the HTML source.Who needs Photoshop?! \u00ab Previous in Category Posted on March 29, 2011 in JavaScript & CSS and tagged as: css, CSS3, image-free, ribbons.

Designing websites for kids is a fascinating, challenging, rewarding, and exasperating experience: You\u2019re trying to create a digital experience for people who lack the cognitive capacity to understand abstraction. You\u2019re trying to establish brand loyalty with people who are influenced almost exclusively by their peers. And you\u2019re trying to communicate subjective value propositions to people who can only see things in black-and-white. Add to this the need to collect data from people with a deep-seated fear of sharing personal information, and you\u2019ve got your work cut out for you. Let\u2019s remember, too, that these people are still learning how to read, and haven\u2019t taken Typing 101 yet. Fortunately, it\u2019s possible to create a successful registration process for these folks with an understanding of how their brains work. We\u2019ll explore how to design effective registration forms for kids based on their context, technical skills, and cognitive capabilities. Successful registration forms for kids: have tangible value propositions instead of abstract activities, provide opportunities for creativity, use pictures whenever possible, require little personal data, and use \u201cfriendly\u201d language. Tangible value propositions vs. abstract activities Since kids in this age group find it hard to understand and visualize abstract ideas, it\u2019s important to communicate tangible benefits at the outset of the registration process. During a recent user research session, a seven-year-old boy looking at a popular kids\u2019 site said, \u201cWhy do I have to sign-up? Just to play games? I can play games on other websites without signing in, so I don\u2019t see why I have to sign-up here.\u201d To this boy, the concept of \u201cplaying games\u201d was too abstract. If he could read about (or better yet) see the types of games available on the site, as well as other activities, such as saving his high scores, he would be more likely to register. The Barbie Girls site does a nice job with its registration process. Before entering any information, kids take a virtual \u201ctour\u201d of the site, where they can see and experience activities and assets available to them if they sign-up: Fig 1. Registration on the Barbie Girls site At the beginning of the registration process, kids get to see the outfits they can dress their avatars in as well as how they can customize the site. This clearly communicates one of the main value propositions of the site: Creating and customizing an online presence. It\u2019s more powerful and easier to grasp than simply telling kids they can \u201cmake a Barbie Girl.\u201d LEGO takes a similar approach with its LEGO ID registration process. An animated LEGO man explains sign-up benefits to kids. Pairing text with voice to accompany a well-known character helps reinforce the site\u2019s value proposition as well. Fig 2. The LEGO ID registration, on the second animation screen. Opportunities for creativity When designing a registration flow for adults, the key is to make it quick and easy, allowing fast access to content and information. For kids, the journey is the destination. It\u2019s important to make that journey as fun, engaging, and rewarding as possible. Provide plenty of opportunities for creativity, from crafting user IDs to picking avatars to selecting security questions. Creating a multi-step registration process is a good way to unfold this. It allows kids to become comfortable with the process and can help with later recall, to reinforce ongoing login behavior. Distilling the registration flow on a kids\u2019 site into multiple screens simplifies the process\u2014as counter-intuitive as it may sound. If each screen in the flow contains one step in the process, it provides an ongoing sense of accomplishment, especially if you provide visual \u201drewards\u201d as kids move through the activities. This is quite a departure from designing flows for adults, where each extraneous click is seen as more work and another barrier to accessing desired content. A great approach to this is to invite kids to share a little bit more about themselves in a creative way during each step in the process. PBS KIDS GO! does a really nice job here. In the first registration step, kids \u201cmake up\u201d their own username. Not an e-mail address, not a parent\u2019s name, but a name of their choosing, allowing them to craft their own identity for the site: Fig 3. Creating a username on PBS KIDS. Of course, kids will put in names like \u201cpoopyhead,\u201d \u201dfart face\u201d or worse. This is not only ok, it\u2019s a good thing. They\u2019re testing the limits of the site to see how much they can get away with. By allowing them to create silly usernames (within reason, of course; you\u2019ll want to make sure you have a good obscenity filter in place) you\u2019re telling kids it\u2019s ok to be who they are, it\u2019s ok to be creative, and this is a safe place where they can have fun. Poptropica, a virtual world for kids developed by Pearson\u2019s Family Education Network, also incorporates opportunities for creativity right at the beginning of the registration process. To capture preliminary user data, the site invites kids to create their own characters to use on the site. It walks them through the process, prompting them to share their data in a fun and rewarding way. Fig 4. Creating a character on Poptropica. Pictures Kids ages six through eight are still honing their reading skills. They\u2019re sounding out words (usually aloud) and slowly stringing them together to form thoughts and sentences. This is difficult enough in print, but it\u2019s even harder online, for kids and adults alike. And for people who aren\u2019t skilled readers, typing is even more difficult. To make the registration process easier and more successful for kids, use pictures whenever possible. Ideally, pictures used in a registration process are simple, clear representations of common items that are part of a child\u2019s current context. Animals, food, colors, and vehicles are all good choices. Additionally, the pictures should be easily recognizable, so kids can identify what they\u2019ve selected. PBS KIDS GO! uses pictures in an interesting way, as part of the security-question process. Kids are prompted to select their favorite items from three rows of images. This not only makes the \u201cforgotten password\u201d process fun, it also reinforces the idea of recognition over recall, since kids understand what the pictures represent and know what their favorites are. Fig 5. Pictures are used to make a secret code on PBS KIDS. It\u2019s important to note that while pictures are useful, symbols and icons can be problematic, because, at this age kids are just learning abstract thought. While adults realize that a video camera icon means they can watch videos, kids associate the icon with actually making videos. In a recent usability test evaluating popular kids\u2019 sites, a six-year-old girl pointed out the video camera icon and said, \u201cThis is cool! It means I can make a movie here and share it with my friends.\u201d She wasn\u2019t able to extrapolate the real meaning of the icon based on site context and content. Personal data Today\u2019s kids, while they love the power and possibilities of the internet, are also a bit fearful of it. Their parents have scared them silly about sharing any personal information online. As a result, kids are wary of providing any data, even information as basic as gender and age. In fact, many kids fib about their ages online. A savvy eight-year-old girl, when prompted by the Candystand site to enter her birthdate, said, \u201cI\u2019m going to put that I\u2019m 12. I know it\u2019s lying, but it\u2019s ok because I\u2019m not allowed to tell anyone on the internet anything real about me.\u201d Even though the site didn\u2019t ask for any identifying data (name, address, or e-mail) she was still reluctant to type in anything personal. Similarly, a seven-year-old boy refused to create a Club Penguin account because it asked for a parent\u2019s e-mail address. \u201cYou can\u2019t say anything about yourself on the web. If you do, people will figure out where you live and come to your house and steal your stuff.\u201d Kids\u2019 fears, along with the very real COPPA regulations\u2014which govern the collection and storage of personal information for kids under 13\u2014make data collection a risky proposition. If you absolutely need to collect some sort of data (other than a basic username and password) to provide a more robust experience or to learn about the type of users coming to the site, keep it generic, friendly, and fun. Funbrain's Math Arcade takes an interesting approach to personal data. To get a game piece, kids need to select their grade and gender. The site collects this information via interactive widgets as opposed to data entry fields. This feels safer to kids, because they\u2019re not actually entering any real data, they\u2019re just playing along with the game. In testing this site, a six-year-old girl said, \u201cThis is cool. They want to know my grade and if I\u2019m a boy or a girl. I think they do this to make sure they give me games that won\u2019t be babyish or too hard.\u201d Fig 6. Funbrain's registration screen feels like a game. The site then provides a password so kids can come back and continue the games from where they left off. In a departure from other kids\u2019 sites, Funbrain only requires the auto-generated password to log in, not a user name. This makes kids feel more comfortable, primarily because it\u2019s system-generated, so they\u2019re not revealing anything personal, and because they don\u2019t have to provide any sort of user name. The one drawback to this is that kids can\u2019t create their own passwords, which would make it easier for them to remember. A six-year-old boy said, \u201cI like how it gives you a password because then you don\u2019t have to put your real one. But I think I\u2019m going to forget it, even if I write it down.\u201d \ufffc Fig 7. The Funbrain password screen assigns a system-generated password. Language Kids are pretty smart when it comes to web terminology. They know what it means to \u201csign-up,\u201d \u201csign-in,\u201d and \u201center passwords.\u201d However, some terms that adults consider common to the web are intimidating to kids, especially the younger ones. Terms like \u201cusername,\u201d \u201csecurity question,\u201d and \u201csubmit\u201d are confusing and disorienting. A seven-year-old girl pointed out the word \u201csubmit\u201d on a registration form and asked what it said. After hearing the word, she said, \u201cSubmit? Like my homework?\u201d It\u2019s better to use words directly related to the task at hand, like sign-in, get started, or find out, instead of self-referential commands like submit, click here, or read more. By the same token, kids don\u2019t like being patronized or talked down to. For example, referring to other players or users as \u201cfriends\u201d is presumptuous and a little demeaning. An eight-year-old girl, playing on the Webkinz site, said, \u201cThese are not my friends. A website doesn\u2019t know who my friends are.\u201d Additionally, simplifying \u201cpassword\u201d to something like \u201csecret key\u201d or \u201cprivate code\u201d is not only patronizing, but confusing. A seven-year-old boy said, \u201cWhat\u2019s a secret code? Is it like a password?\u201d Additionally, kids in this age group are still slightly egocentric, meaning they have trouble seeing things from other perspectives. As a result, words like \u201cme,\u201d \u201cmy,\u201d and \u201cmine\u201d are confusing. A six-year-old boy said, during a user research activity, \u201cWho\u2019s talking here?\u201d When probed for more detail, he said, \u201cThis says \u2018my user name.\u2019 Whose name? Who is this?\u201d He didn\u2019t understand that the \u201cme\u201d on the site was referring to him. Here are some kid-friendly wording options for common web terms: Wording Options Use\u0085 Instead of\u0085 Sign-up Register Sign-in Log In Start Submit Nickname / Site Name Name / User Name You / Your / Yours Me / My / Mine Password Secret Code <site name> Friends Friends, or Other Players In conclusion Designing registration forms for kids\u2019 sites is a tricky business. Limitations in cognitive capacity, reading and typing skills, and technical ability create constraints that seem insurmountable at times. However, with a little creativity, a lot of experimentation, and iterative testing, it\u2019s possible to design forms that capture data in a fun, engaging, and rewarding way.

What I'm trying to do here is provide a resource for folks that want to learn more about expressions and scripting in After Effects. I'm in the process of overhauling the site. I'm afraid it hasn't had much attention in the last couple of years because I've been so busy, but I hope to add new content on a more regular basis. There's a lot of new stuff to talk about. My plan is to leave the old parts of the site up until I can supercede them with more up-to-date material. Enjoy your visit and please check back occasionally for new content. Dan I've been writing scripts and expressions commercially, on a freelance basis, pretty much since those features were added to After Effects. My scripting services have been commissioned for a wide range of projects including work flow automation, archival, complex animation, and video game development. My clients use my scripts to eliminate huge amounts of tedious, repetitive work, or to simply make an otherwise impossible animation possible. I've worked on some large projects, but most scripts take less than a day to create. Much of my work has involved creating scripts that will read a monthly schedule (or some other text document) and use that information to perform media and text replacement, resulting in customized renders for each day, event, game scenario, etc. I've also created numerous floating palette-based scripts to assist animators in applying complex character animation. Partial list of clients: Adobe, blank (Nike and T-Mobile campaigns),CBS, NBA TV, Showtime, Little Airplane Productions (Wonder Pets), Center City Film and Video (Comcast), and Plastic Cow (Disney). I've also done some Flash and ActionScript design/development. If you think you might benefit from some help like this and would like to discuss options, please contact me.. This is where you will find new content on expressions. Basically, in the spirit of the Expressions Lab, this is a series of stand-alone topics designed to showcase a particular useful technique or concept. Here though, I've tried to include a more detailed analysis/explanation of the code than you will find in the Lab topics. This is a collection of topics designed for those that are intent on mastering the art of writing expressions for After Effects. This is my original mini-site consisting of a small collection of experiments with expressions for After Effects. Not a lot of in-depth explanation here, but maybe you will find something useful. This is a well-intentioned but admittedly inadequate introduction to scripting for After Effects. I hope to correct this, once I get the Expressioneer's Design Guide fleshed out. JavaScript: The Definitive Guide by David FlanaganAnybody that's serious about scripting and expressions needs a good JavaScript reference. This is the one I use. Creating Motion Graphics With After Effects by Trish & Chris MeyerWhat can you say? This masterpiece contains the best expressions reference in print today. After Effects Pro: Professional Features by Total TrainingAnother wonderful resource for mastering expressions. If you prefer video-based training, this is what you want. Creative CowYou can usually find me hanging out in the After Effects and After Effects Expressions forums. Adobe User to User ForumsI also frequently visit the After Effects forum (especially the Expressions and Scripting folders) of Adobe's site. redefineryJeff Almasol's fabulous site for everything scripting.

He was called the \u201cgreatest American humorist of his age.\u201d He wrote the now classic novels, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.He wrote some great stuff that is still read by millions today. He also had some great quotes that continue to live on because of the wisdom in them. Mark Twain was a funny, witty, and wise guy. I hope the below quotes will astonish, enlighten, and amuse you.\"I have been through some terrible things in my life, some of which actually happened.\"We walk around all our lives thinking about things that will never happen. We worry, dread, and fear what hasn\u2019t happened and what probably never will.Our minds are out of control. Our heads are filled with negative thoughts that have no bearing in reality, even if we think they do.Eliminating bad thoughts is possible, through methods such as EFT and The Work. It\u2019s not easy, but worth it. \u201cTwenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.\u201dWe want safety. We want to be secure, but the best life experiences come when we drop those notions and go after what we truly want, whether it feels safe or not.I\u2019ve battled with this myself, and I often stop myself from doing things because it feels unsafe. I worry too much about the future.In reality, we can\u2019t know what the future will bring. Even if you have millions in the bank, you may lose it tomorrow. Not even the wealthiest on this planet are secure.\u201cWhen people do not respect us we are sharply offended; yet in his private heart no man much respects himself.\u201dImagine that something negative happened to you. Maybe someone said something to you that you thought was wrong.How often do you replay what happened over and over and over again when it\u2019s all over?We disrespect ourselves by replaying bad thoughts in our mind, which leads to feeling bad, and treating everyone (including ourselves) around us badly.\u201cThe secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one.\u201dGoing after your dreams can feel like an overwhelming task, but that\u2019s because you\u2019re trying to visualize something in your head that cannot be visualized.Mark Twain is right on in breaking things into small pieces. It works because you can hold an image in your head of what the end result looks like. Instead of thinking \u201cI need to start an online business,\u201d a better thought would be \u201cI need to start a blog.\u201dThat is, if you want to go down that route. Break things down, and simplify!\u201cWhen angry, count to four. When very angry, swear.\u201dA good and funny quote, but to me it sends the message to not make decisions when you\u2019re angry. People are foolish when they are angry. They snap at others and only create more trouble in their life. Next time you\u2019re angry, either use methods such as The Work or EFT, like I mentioned above, or just count to four, or better yet, ten.Calm down, and sleep on your decision.\u201cDon't go around saying the world owes you a living; the world owes you nothing; it was here first.\u201dHave you ever felt like you deserved something, but didn\u2019t get it? I know I certainly have. That thought does us no good, even if we think we did deserve whatever it is that we didn\u2019t get. It keeps you stuck instead of moving forward. So what if things didn\u2019t go perfectly? You adjust and you keep on going.Who knows, maybe that setback wasn\u2019t a setback after all. The negative events in my life have a tendency to blossom into positive ones. \u201cCourage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear - not absence of fear.\u201dSuccessful people aren\u2019t fearless; no one is. It\u2019s easy to believe that if you got rid of your fears, everything would be fine, but that\u2019s just an excuse for not getting started. You will always have a smidgen of fear when diving into the unknown. Don\u2019t let it stop you; instead use it as fuel to keep going.Written on 3/26/2011 by Henri Junttila.

{"url":"http://www.carallumaemagrece.net/","title":"Caralluma Emagrece","tags":["caralluma-emagrece"],"body":" Caralluma Emagrece\u00a0 \u00a0 Caralluma If you are looking for a great way to lose weight, one of the best things to do is to look at the customs and eating habits of world native populations because these groups of people are usually thin and certainly never obese. The drug caralluma emagrece has recently been growing in popularity. However, its roots stem to ancient India where it was used by native groups there for countless generations. They use the plant form of caralluma emagrece called Caralluma fimbriata in many of their traditional dishes. Most notably, it was used by hunters to sustain themselves while hunting. The plant alleviated their hunger and thirst while they hunted. Scientists have studied extracts of this plant and compared their effectiveness in combating weight loss. When compared to a group that ingested a placebo, the group that ingested the plant extracts actually had smaller waists by the end of the study. If you are curious about this little gem of a secret that Indians have used for centuries, you do not have to travel the world to find it. Now caralluma emagrece is available in a pill form that combines the finest most effective parts of the plant extracts. The success stories of people who have used it are incredible. Some testimonials claim that people have lost up to a third of their body weight after starting a regime of these pills. The best part is, however, that it is not another fad diet because it has been effectively used for literally centuries. People who use it claim that it is far superior to most caffeine based pills as it does not give the user the jittery feeling that always comes from too much caffeine. In addition to suppressing hunger, caralluma emagrece works with your body's biochemistry to encourage the loss of fat cells. Your body has a virtual memory that makes it want to hold onto fat cells especially those that it has had since childhood. However, when caralluma emagrece is introduced into your system, it effectively disrupts this portion of your body's memory. If centuries worth of caralluma emagrece use in India is not enough to convince you of its efficacy, the fact that its use is growing fastest in Hollywood should certainly convince you that it is awesome. Movie stars have more money than most people do, and thus, they can always buy the best. You may not be able to drive a Porsche or live in a mansion, but you can look as good as any Hollywood beauty once you have this in your hand.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 CarallumaCha Verde EmagreceCaralluma EmagreceCaralluma FimbriataCaralluma Fimbriata ComprarCaralluma Fimbriata Efeitos ColateraisCaralluma Fimbriata PosologiaComo Emagrecer Em 1 SemanaEmagrecer Em Uma SemanaErvas Para EmagrecerFrutas Que EmagrecemOleo De Cartamo EmagreceRemedio Natural Para EmagrecerCaralluma Weight Loss Contact Us | Privacy Policy | Terms Of Use | Affiliate Disclaimer | Site MapPowered by Website Traffic | Google | Bing | YahooCaralluma | Caralluma "}

Painfully, Sherlock began the seemingly endless crawl from one end of the warehouse to another. By the time the police got here, there would be no sign that the gang had even been there. Sherlock cursed as his ribs twinged. His knees and palms hurt too- there was broken glass on the floor, and now it was in his knees. His questing hands found the upright strut of a shelf.\u00a0 Slowly, wincingly, he pulled himself up. One leg threatened to give out on him completely, twisted when he fell through the roof. Using the shelf as a support he pulled himself to the fire escape, and limped out. Outside, in the alleyway, he stopped to lean against the wall. Breathing hurt- probably some idiot\u2019s boot had cracked a rib, how tiresome. He straightened up, and pitched forward as his leg finally gave out on him. He rolled over, laboriously. He was aware he was lying in a puddle, but for now, he was quite content to watch the few stars that had made it through the smog and light. They swirled like milk in coffee, which Sherlock realised (with the sort of detachment that comes from not enough sleep and a blow to the head) didn\u2019t usually happen. His phone beeped. Unread messages, some missed calls. From JW: I\u2019m coming home- anything from the shop? From JW: Please can you not leave that sort of thing festering in coffee mugs. From JW: Lestrade just called, where are you? From Lestrade: We\u2019ve found our man, he might have something for us. Want to see? From Lestrade: Can\u2019t wait any longer, let you know what I find out. Learn to answer your damn phone or get a secretary. From JW: Well, I\u2019m glad you don\u2019t need my help or anything. I\u2019m going to the pub with Bill. From JW: No, really, where are you? Sherlock sighed, though he wasn\u2019t exactly displeased. He focussed on the screen. It took a lot more effort than you might think. From SH: Im a gutver. Direcions om on computes. sH. From JW: Are you drunk? From SH: No. Dn\u2019t drhnk. From JW: I\u2019ll be there soon, try not to get into any more trouble. Sherlock let the phone fall from his fingers, brittle sound of plastic on damp gravel. Carefully he drew himself upright. Little stars and bursts of light went off behind his eyes, and for a moment he thought he might be sick. He decided not. If he could stand up, he wouldn\u2019t have to go to the hospital. He started pulling himself up the wall, inch by inch. He could feel dirty water trickling out his hair and into his collar. He shivered. His phone went off. \u201cHolmes,\u201d he grunted. \u201cSherlock? Where are you?\u201d It was Lestrade. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the affidavit we need, we can move now,\u201d \u201cWell, don\u2019t come here, there\u2019s nothing-,\u201d Sherlock stopped talking and looked at the door where he had come out. Lestrade was saying something, but Sherlock cut off the call impatiently. He definitely knew where the loot was. Definitely, even though every thought felt a bit like it was coming from a badly-tuned radio. He limped back into the warehouse. There was the safe, hidden behind the picture of the Queen. The safe had a combination, and Sherlock briefly wished he\u2019d bought a stethoscope. His head hurt. He laid it against the wall, which was wonderfully cool. From JW: I contacted Lestrade, are you inside? I will be there quite shortly. From SH: Y He simply had to get the safe open, even if it felt like he was trying to think with cottage cheese instead of proper gray matter. He spun the wheel carefully, pressing an ear to the safe door. \u201cOi!\u201d the speaker was dressed as a security guard, but had no doubt been sent to check that Sherlock was either gone or dead. He moved quicker than Sherlock had pegged him, but he still managed to dodge the first blow, which slammed into the safe-door. It popped open, revealing its contents. Sherlock blinked and looked at the other man, who was shaking out his fist, and looking murder at Sherlock. The next blow hit home. Sherlock felt a crunch of bone in his nose and then exploding black and red stars clouded his vision. But he hadn\u2019t fallen over, he felt like that was a small victory. The security guard was winding up for another blow so Sherlock did the only thing he could think of, and kicked the man square in the crotch. It was not the most honourable move, but the bigger man curled up so satisfactorily, it seemed worth the pain that had exploded in his knee. Sherlock could hear footsteps. In the safe were the jewels, flawless diamonds, rubies glowing crimson, crystalline emeralds, set in delicate gold, and shining silver. A king\u2019s ransom. Sherlock thought: \u2018Right, well, that seems to be about it,\u2019 and allowed himself to fold up onto the floor as John came bursting through the door. -- \u201cOh, (cough) the hospital,\u201d Sherlock\u2019s voice sounded husky. John folded up the paper. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d he offered, by way of confirmation and greeting, and handed Sherlock a glass of water. \u201cTwo cracked ribs, a nasty knock on the back of the head, so concussion too, sprained knee, broken nose, not to mention broken glass pretty much everywhere and innumerable bruises. And you took on Dangerous Wee Gary. He\u2019s still not walking right though, so good job there,\u201d \u201cYou might want to tell Lestrade that he\u2019ll want to talk to Whelk-Boy- what charming names these people have- to either arrest him or put him under protective custody. All that about killing women, it was a clue, not a threat,\u201d \u201cTell him yourself, he\u2019ll be by shortly,\u201d \u201cOh, no, I can\u2019t. I have a concussion,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t care,\u201d \u201cYes you do,\u201d Silence, except for the sound of the hospital functioning around them. John leant on the back of his chair. \u201cYes, I do. But you\u2019re still giving the statement.\u201d \u201cBut-,\u201d \u201cNo buts. You had me worried sick! Do you know how much you bleed?\u201d \u201cI have a good idea,\u201d Sherlock picked at the gauze covering the palms of his hands. \u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d John reached out and slapped his hands. Sherlock grinned, and then winced as it stretched his nose. He reached up to touch it. John held his hands down. \u201cReally,\u201d Sherlock smiled up at him, close enough to kiss. John moved back quickly, wiping his hands down his jeans. Sherlock looked down. \u201cYes, well, it doesn\u2019t matter what I think,\u201d John said, grumpily. \u201cYou\u2019re giving the statement, or I\u2019ll tell Mycroft you\u2019re awake, apparently you stopped a rather nasty international incident,\u201d Another moment of silence. \u201cFine,\u201d Sherlock folded his arms, and slumped back against his pillows. John hid a smile. \u201cIf you\u2019re good I\u2019ll get you an ice-cream,\u201d \u201cShut up,\u201d\u00a0Tags: bbc sherlock, crossposting to sherlockbbc with any luc, fic, fill, fluff for all, g, no title cause i suck, oneshot, please don't everyone hate this, pre-slash, prompt filling, sherlock/john, should be studying, ust ( 20 comments \u2014 Leave a comment )pennies_4_eyes2010-10-20 07:14 am (UTC) This was marvelous!

Delegate handling of user events with views. Use bindings to update views when your models change. You will learn all of this by building a real Todo list application from the ground up using SproutCore. Chapters Generate Your New Application Defining Your Model Managing the Model Using a Controller Creating New Todos with a Text Field Getting Things Done The More You Know Clearing Completed Todos Marking All as Done Changelog 1 Generate Your New Application First, generate your new HTML-based application. $ sc-init todos --template This will create several files needed for your application, inside the apps/todos directory. apps/ todos/ todos.js \u2013 The JavaScript file that will define your models, views, and controllers resources/ templates/ \u2013 Place all Handlebars templates here. todos.handlebars \u2013 The main template for the application images/ \u2013 Place all image assets here. stylesheets/ \u2013 Place all css here todos.css \u2013 The CSS to style your views tests/ Buildfile \u2013 Tells SproutCore how your application should be built. Usually, you can just use the defaults provided. README Go ahead and open todos.js now. You should see the following code: apps/todos/todos.js Todos = SC.Application.create(); jQuery(document).ready(function() { Todos.mainPane = SC.TemplatePane.append({ layerId: \"todo\", templateName: \"todos\" }); }); This code creates a namespace for your application (called Todos), then appends a new pane. A pane is responsible for event delegation and placing your templates into the DOM, but you\u2019ll learn more about that later. 2 Defining Your Model In this tutorial, we want to create a list for managing todos. Users should be able to create a new todo with a specific task, then check it off once it\u2019s done. Let\u2019s define our model as a new subclass of SC.Object: apps/todos/todos.js Todos = SC.Application.create(); Todos.Todo = SC.Object.extend({ title: null, isDone: false }); jQuery(document).ready(function() { Todos.mainPane = SC.TemplatePane.append({ layerId: 'todos', templateName: 'todos' }); }); Make sure you insert the new code after the Todos object is created. We\u2019ve now defined a class with two properties: title, a string, and isDone, a Boolean. 3 Managing the Model Using a Controller Now that we know what our data looks like, let\u2019s create a controller to manage it. Since we want to maintain an ordered list of todos, we\u2019ll use an instance of SC.ArrayController. in apps/todos/todos.js // at the end of the file Todos.todoListController = SC.ArrayController.create({ // Initialize the array controller with an empty array. content: [] }); In MVC frameworks, like SproutCore, the controller layer bridges the model layer, which is only concerned with a pure-data representation of objects, and the view layer, which is only concerned with representing those objects. Now we have an array controller with no content. Let\u2019s add a method to create a new todo: in apps/todos/todos.js // updating previous code Todos.todoListController = SC.ArrayController.create({ // Initialize the array controller with an empty array. content: [], // Creates a new todo with the passed title, then adds it // to the array. createTodo: function(title) { var todo = Todos.Todo.create({ title: title }); this.pushObject(todo); } }); You might find the pushObject call in the above code confusing. SC.ArrayController and the related SC.ObjectController behave as a proxies for the object you set as their \u201ccontent\u201d property. This means that when you work with controllers, instead of accessing properties on the controller content you will access the controller itself. For example, you can normally bind views in your UI directly to the ArrayController and they will work as if you bound directly to the content array. The advantage of this is that you can later change the content of the controller to point to another array and UI will update appropriately without needing you to reconfigure each UI item individually. 4 Creating New Todos with a Text Field At this point, you should download the CSS and save it as apps/todos/resources/stylesheets/todos.css. We\u2019ve got our model and controller set up, so let\u2019s move on to the fun part: creating the interface for our users. The first step is to create a text field into which the user types the name of their todo. To start building our views, let\u2019s open resources/templates/todos.handlebars and add some markup: todos.handlebars <h1>Todos</h1> <input id=\"new-todo\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"What needs to be done?\" > Now that we\u2019ve got model, view, and controller represented, it\u2019s time to open the app in our browser and see how it looks. During the development process, sc-server makes it easy to test your application. Just run the following inside of your project directory: $ sc-server Starting server at http://0.0.0.0:4020 in debug mode To quit sc-server, press Control-C >> Thin web server (v1.2.7 codename No Hup) >> Maximum connections set to 1024 >> Listening on 0.0.0.0:4020, CTRL+C to stop Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:4020/todos. You should see your application load. Once you have it up and running, it\u2019s time to tell SproutCore how to handle events for your <input> tag. When the user presses return, we want to create a new Todo and have it inserted into the array controller. In SproutCore, whenever you want to display dynamic content or handle events, you will need to attach your HTML to a view object. in apps/todos/todos.js // at the end of the file Todos.CreateTodoView = SC.TemplateView.create(SC.TextFieldSupport, { insertNewline: function() { var value = this.get('value'); if (value) { Todos.todoListController.createTodo(value); this.set('value', ''); } } }); Because CreateTodoView contains a text field, we mix in SC.TextFieldSupport, which provides several conveniences, including a value property, and higher level events such as insertNewline, for when the user presses return. When creating a new object, you can include a mixin, which will extend the default behavior of the class. In this case, we extend the default TemplateView behavior with functionality specific to views that wrap input tags. You can include as many mixins as you\u2019d like by passing them as parameters to create() and extend(). Now that we have defined our view, we need to attach it to HTML in our Handlebars template. apps/todos/resources/templates/todos.handlebars <h1>Todos</h1> {{#view \"Todos.CreateTodoView\"}} <input id=\"new-todo\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"What needs to be done?\" /> {{/view}} #view is a Handlebars block helper that assigns an SC.TemplateView to a section of HTML. This means that the behavior described in the specified view, such as event handling, will get associated with the HTML inside the block. Now that we have UI to create new todos, let\u2019s create the interface to display them. We\u2019ll use the #collection helper to display a list of items. #collection will create an instance of SC.TemplateCollectionView that renders every item in its underlying Array using the enclosed HTML. in apps/todos/resources/templates/todos.handlebars <!-- at the end of the file --> {{#collection \"Todos.todoListView\"}} {{content.title}} {{/collection}} Back in todos.js, we need to define the collection class that we passed to the collection helper. To define the collection\u2019s underlying Array, we bind its content property to the todoListController. In this case, that means that the todoListView will create a <div> containing the Todo\u2019s title for each item in the todoListController. in apps/todos/todos.js // at the end of the file Todos.todoListView = SC.TemplateCollectionView.create({ contentBinding: 'Todos.todoListController' }); You set up bindings by creating a property whose name ends in Binding. In this case, we bind Todos.todoListController to the Todos.todoListView\u2019s content property. When one end of a binding changes, SproutCore will automatically update the other end. Open up \u201chttp://localhost:4020/todos\u201d:\"http://localhost:4020/todos in your browser (or reload if you still have it open). It should look the same as before. Type a todo into the text field and hit return. Look at that! As soon as we create a new todo and insert it into the array controller, the view updates automatically. You\u2019ve now seen a little bit of the power of SproutCore. By using SproutCore\u2019s bindings to describe the relationship between your data and your views, you were able to change the data layer and let SproutCore do the hard work of updating the view layer for you. This is actually a core concept in SproutCore, not just something that demos well. SproutCore\u2019s binding system is designed with the view system in mind, which makes it easy to work directly with your data and not need to worry about manually keeping your view layer in sync. You will see this concept over and over again in the rest of this tutorial and in other guides. 5 Getting Things Done We now have the ability to add todos, but no way to mark them as done. Before the frustration of a never-ending todo list gets the better of us, let\u2019s add the ability to mark todos as complete. The first thing we need to do is add a checkbox to each todo view. If we want to handle user input, we need to assign a view to the checkbox. In this case, we want to be notified whenever the value of the checkbox is changed by the user. Remember that we assign views using the #view helper. Here\u2019s what the todo list looks like after updating it in todos.handlebars: in apps/todos/resources/templates/todos.handlebars <!-- replacing the previous code --> {{#collection \"Todos.todoListView\"}} <label> {{#view \"Todos.CheckboxView\"}} <input class=\"check\" type=\"checkbox\"> {{/view}} {{content.title}} </label> {{/collection}} Now implement Todos.CheckboxView, which we just assigned. Because our view wraps an input tag of type checkbox, we mix in SC.CheckboxSupport. This gives the view a value property that reflects the value in the DOM, and, because it is a SproutCore property, we can observe any changes to it. Under the hood, SproutCore binds an event handler to the change event and updates value when the event occurs. This may change as needed for browser compatibility, and working with a SproutCore property insulates you from those concerns. For every item in its underlying Array, SC.TemplateCollectionView will create a new child view whose content property contains the object the view should represent. In our case, there will be a child view for each todo, and each will have a content property set to a corresponding Todo object. This makes it easy to bind the value of the checkbox to the value of isDone, so that when one changes, the other changes automatically. Let\u2019s tie it all together: in apps/todos/todos.js // at the end of the file Todos.CheckboxView = SC.TemplateView.extend(SC.CheckboxSupport, { valueBinding: '.parentView.content.isDone' }); Until now, SproutCore has been creating item views for each Todo for us. Often, you will want to add custom behavior to these views. In that case, you can provide your SC.TemplateCollectionView with an SC.TemplateView subclass that it will use instead. In our todos app, we want to display completed todos in a different visual style than uncompleted todos. We\u2019ll do that using CSS, but first we\u2019ll need to add an HTML class so the browser can distinguish between the two. We\u2019ll use a property on the collection helper to set up this binding: in apps/todos/todos.js <!-- replacing the previous code --> {{#collection \"Todos.todoListView\" itemClassBinding=\"content.isDone\"}} <label> {{#view \"Todos.CheckboxView\"}} <input class=\"check\" type=\"checkbox\"> {{/view}} {{content.title}} </label> {{/collection}} This property defines a binding on each of the item views. Each item will get the class is-done if its associated content object is isDone. SproutCore will automatically dasherize property names into class names. All views have a number of properties, including id, class, and classBinding. The collection helper allows you to prefix any of those properties with item, which will then apply them to each of the child item views. For instance, if you use the itemClass property on a collection, each item will get that class. Reload your application in the browser and try it out. As soon as you click a todo\u2019s checkbox, the text will become crossed out. Keep in mind you didn\u2019t need to update any views when marking the Todo as done; bindings did it for. If a different part of the app changes the Todo item\u2019s isDone property, your list item would automatically update without any more work on your part. 6 The More You Know We can now create todos and mark them as being complete. While 76% of all statistics are made up, let\u2019s see if we can display more accurate information from the data we have. At the bottom of our list, let\u2019s display the number of todos remaining. Open todos.handlebars and put this at the bottom: in apps/todos/resources/templates/todos.handlebars <!-- after the create todo view --> {{#view \"Todos.statsView\" id=\"stats\"}} {{bind \"displayRemaining\"}} {{/view}} The bind helper allows us to automatically update the DOM when a property on our view changes. In this case, we\u2019re saying that we should insert the value of the view\u2019s displayRemaining property whenever it changes. Let\u2019s go ahead and implement that view in todos.js now: in apps/todos/todos.js // at the end of the file Todos.statsView = SC.TemplateView.create({ remainingBinding: 'Todos.todoListController.remaining', displayRemaining: function() { var remaining = this.get('remaining'); return remaining + (remaining === 1 ? \" item\" : \" items\"); }.property('remaining').cacheable() }); displayRemaining contains a pluralized string, based on the number of remaining todos. We call this a computed property. Computed properties are properties whose value is determined by running a function. For example, if remaining equals 1, displayRemaining will contain the string \"1 item\". We say that displayRemaining depends on remaining because it requires another value to generate its own value. We list these dependent keys inside the property() declaration. We\u2019ve also bound the view\u2019s remaining property to the todoListController\u2018s remaining property. This means that, because of the dependency chain we\u2019ve described, if Todos.todoListController.remaining changes, displayRemaining will automatically update. When we have information that views need but is based on aggregate information about our models, the array controller is a good place to put it. Let\u2019s add a new computed property to todoListController in todos.js: in apps/todos/todos.js // updating previous code Todos.todoListController = SC.ArrayController.create({ // ... remaining: function() { return this.filterProperty('isDone', false).get('length'); }.property('@each.isDone') }); Here, we specify our dependent key using @each. This allows us to depend on properties of the array\u2019s items. In this case, we want to update the remaining property any time isDone changes on a Todo. The @each property also updates when an item is added or removed. It\u2019s important to declare dependent keys because SproutCore uses this information to know when to update bindings. In our case, our statsView updates any time todoListController\u2019s remaining property changes. Here\u2019s how it all fits together: As we build up our application, we create declarative links between objects. These links describe how application state flows from the model layer to the HTML in the presentation layer. 7 Clearing Completed Todos As we populate our list with todos, we may want to periodically clear out those we\u2019ve completed. As you have learned, we will want to make that change to the todoListController, and let SproutCore automatically propagate those changes to the DOM. Let\u2019s add a new clearCompletedTodos method to the controller. in apps/todos/todos.js // updating existing code Todos.todoListController = SC.ArrayController.create({ // ... clearCompletedTodos: function() { this.filterProperty('isDone', true).forEach(this.removeObject, this); } }); Next, we\u2019ll add the HTML to our template and connect it up to a view for event handling. Open todos.handlebars and add a button inside the HTML for statsView: in apps/todos/resources/templates/todos.handlebars <!-- updating existing code --> {{#view \"Todos.statsView\" id=\"stats\"}} {{#view \"Todos.clearCompletedView\"}} <button>Clear Completed Todos</button> {{/view}} {{bind \"displayRemaining\"}} remaining. {{/view}} Now implement Todos.clearCompletedView: in apps/todos/todos.js // at the end of the file Todos.clearCompletedView = SC.TemplateView.create({ mouseUp: function() { Todos.todoListController.clearCompletedTodos(); } }); Fire up your browser and try it out. Add some todos, then mark them done and clear them. Because we previously bound the visual list to the todoListController, making a change through new means has the expected effect. 8 Marking All as Done Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve decided to lay off the hooch for a day and actually get all of your work done. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have a way to easily mark every todo as complete? It turns out that, due to our application\u2019s declarative nature, all the hard work is already done. We just need a way to mark every Todo complete. Let\u2019s first create a new computed property on our controller that describes whether or not every todo is done. It might look something like this: in apps/todos/todos.js // updating existing code Todos.todoListController = SC.ArrayController.create({ // ... allAreDone: function() { return this.get('length') && this.everyProperty('isDone', true); }.property('@each.isDone') }); SproutCore has many enumerable helpers. everyProperty(\u2018isDone\u2019, true) returns true if every item in the array has an isDone property that evaluates to true. You can find the full list of helpers in SC.Enumerable. Next, we\u2019ll create a checkbox to mark all items complete and bind it to this property: in apps/todos/resources/templates/todos.handlebars <!-- at the end of the file --> {{#view \"Todos.markAllDoneView\"}} <label> <input class=\"mark-all-done\" type=\"checkbox\"> Mark All as Done </label> {{/view}} in apps/todos/todos.js // at the end of the file Todos.markAllDoneView = SC.TemplateView.create(SC.CheckboxSupport, { valueBinding: 'Todos.todoListController.allAreDone' }); If you reload your browser and use the app, you\u2019ll notice that clicking all of the checkboxes of your todos will cause the \u201cMark All as Done\u201d checkbox to become checked. However, it doesn\u2019t work in the other direction: clicking \u201cMark All as Done\u201d has no effect. So far, our computed properties have described how to calculate a value from dependent properties. In this case, we want to accept a new value, and update dependent properties to reflect it. in apps/todos/todos.js // updating existing code Todos.todoListController = SC.ArrayController.create({ // ... allAreDone: function(key, value) { if (value !== undefined) { this.setEach('isDone', value); return value; } else { return this.get('length') && this.everyProperty('isDone', true); } }.property('@each.isDone') }); When you set a computed property, your function is called with the property key as the first parameter and the new value as the second. To determine if SproutCore is asking for the value or trying to set it, we examine the value parameter. If it is defined, we iterate through each Todo and set its isDone property to the new value. Because bindings are bidirectional, SproutCore will set allAreDone to true when the user clicks the \u201cMark All as Done\u201d checkbox. Conversely, unchecking it will make SproutCore set allAreDone to false, unchecking all todos. Reload the app and add some todos. Click \u201cMark All as Done\u201d. Wow! Each of the individual check boxes gets checked off. If you uncheck one of them, the \u201cMark All as Done\u201d checkbox unchecks itself. When you use SproutCore, as you scale your UI, you never need to wonder whether a new feature will work consistently with parts of the UI you already implemented.

Biloxi - The Obama administration has issued a gag order on data over the recent spike of dead dolphins, including many stillborn infants, washing up on Mississippi and Alabama shorelines, and scientists say the restriction undermines the scientific process. An abnormal dolphin mortality this year along the Gulf coast has become part of a federal criminal investigation over last year\u2019s BP oil spill disaster and as a result, has led the US government to clamp down on biologists\u2019 findings, with orders to keep the results confidential. The dolphin die-off, labeled an \u201cunusual mortality event (UME),\u201d resulted in wildlife biologists being contracted by the National Marine Fisheries Service to record the recent spike in dolphin deaths by collecting tissue samples and specimens for the agency, but late last month were privately ordered to keep their results under wraps. Reuters has obtained a copy of the agency letter that states, in part: \u201cBecause of the seriousness of the legal case, no data or findings may be released, presented or discussed outside the UME investigative team without prior approval.\u201d One biologist involved with tracking dolphin mortalities for over 20 years and speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters that: \u201cIt throws accountability right out the window. We are confused and ... we are angry because they claim they want teamwork, but at the same time they are leaving the marine experts out of the loop completely.\u201d Some scientists said they have received a personal rebuke from government officials about \u201cspeaking out of turn\u201d to the media over attempts at determining the dolphins\u2019 deaths. Additionally, these scientists say the collected specimens and samples are being turned over to the government for evaluation under a deal that omits independent scientists from the final results of lab tests. Almost 200 dead bottlenose dolphin bodies have been found since mid-January through this week along shorelines of Gulf coast states, including Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana, Reuters notes. About half of the carcasses are newborns or stillborn infants. That number is around 14 times the average numbers recorded during the same time frame between 2002 and 2007 and has coincidentally occurred during the first calving season since the BP Deepwater Horizon debacle last year in the Gulf. Although many of the dolphin specimens recently collected show no outward signs of oil contamination, lab analysis is crucial in helping to determine their deaths. Some experts believe the recent surge of deaths is the result of dolphins inhaling or ingesting oil during the oil spill, the results of which are just now beginning to show their toll, including a possible upsurge in dolphin miscarriages. The recent spike in dolphin deaths has compounded the dolphin mortality problem, as scientists were already busy attempting to determine the deaths of nearly 90 dead dolphins, mostly adults, that washed up along the US Gulf coast during the weeks and months after the BP disaster. Some are questioning the Marine Fisheries Service, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and its delay in providing dolphin samples to laboratories. \u201cIt is surprising that it has been almost a full year since the spill, and they still haven't selected labs for this kind of work,\u201d said Ruth Carmichael, of the independent Dauphin Island Sea Lab, located in Alabama, according to Reuters. \u201cI can only hope that this process is a good thing. I just don\u2019t know. This is an unfortunate situation,\u201d she added. Officials with the NOAA state the confidentiality measures are an integral part of the current investigation over the BP oil spill. \u201cWe are treating the evidence, which are the dolphin samples, like a murder case,\u201d said Dr. Erin Fougeres, a Fisheries Service marine biologist, Reuters notes. \u201cThe chain of custody is being closely watched. Every dolphin sample is considered evidence in the BP case now,\u201d she added. article:305096:271::0 More about dead dolphins, dead baby dolphins, Gulf oil spill, bp oil spill, Gulf coast More news from dead dolphins dead baby dolphins Gulf oil spill bp oil spill Gulf coast gulf coast states dolphin deaths Obama administration Bottlenose dolphins national marine fish... dolphins found dead NOAA Criminal investigati... stillborn dolp \u00a0\u00a0Social Comments \u00a0\u00a0Digital Journal Comments (9) More from Politics Obama defends Libyan action while cost of operation soars Op-Ed: Is Bashar al-Assad willing and able to modernize Syria?

Now of course you can do these things with most graphics applications -- applications that take a while to load and learn, cost money, and most importantly,\u00a0do not have any weasels. Here then enters\u00a0pngweasel. It's lightweight, it's free, it's easy to use, and yes, there is a weasel. You can also visit pngweasel's cousin utility,\u00a0gifweasel for your GIF image transparency editing needs. \u00a0 Download, it's free! The latest version of pngweasel is 1.0, released on May 4th 2008. It runs on Intel-based and PowerPC-based Mac computers and is compatible with Mac OS X v. 10.4.4 or later.

Just type: wget http://fly.cc.fer.hr/ The response will be something like: --13:30:45-- http://fly.cc.fer.hr:80/ => `index.html' Connecting to fly.cc.fer.hr:80... connected! HTTP request sent, fetching headers... done. Length: 1,749 [text/html] 0K -> . 13:30:46 (68.32K/s) - `index.html' saved [1749/1749] But what will happen if the connection is slow, and the file is lengthy? The connection will probably fail before the whole file is retrieved, more than once. In this case, Wget will try getting the file until it either gets the whole of it, or exceeds the default number of retries (this being 20). It is easy to change the number of tries to 45, to insure that the whole file will arrive safely: wget --tries=45 http://fly.cc.fer.hr/jpg/flyweb.jpg Now let's leave Wget to work in the background, and write its progress to log file `log'. It is tiring to type `--tries', so we shall use `-t'. wget -t 45 -o log http://fly.cc.fer.hr/jpg/flyweb.jpg & The ampersand at the end of the line makes sure that Wget works in the background. To unlimit the number of retries, use `-t inf'. The usage of FTP is as simple. Wget will take care of login and password. $ wget ftp://gnjilux.cc.fer.hr/welcome.msg --23:35:55-- ftp://gnjilux.cc.fer.hr:21/welcome.msg => `welcome.msg' Connecting to gnjilux.cc.fer.hr:21... connected! Logging in as anonymous ... Logged in! ==> TYPE I ... done. ==> CWD not needed. ==> PORT ... done. ==> RETR welcome.msg ... done. Length: 1,340 (unauthoritative) 0K -> . 23:35:56 (37.39K/s) - `welcome.msg' saved [1340] If you specify a directory, Wget will retrieve the directory listing, parse it and convert it to HTML. Try: wget ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/ lynx index.html Advanced Usage You would like to read the list of URLs from a file? Not a problem with that: wget -i file If you specify `-' as file name, the URLs will be read from standard input. Create a mirror image of GNU WWW site (with the same directory structure the original has) with only one try per document, saving the log of the activities to `gnulog': wget -r -t1 http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/ -o gnulog Retrieve the first layer of yahoo links: wget -r -l1 http://www.yahoo.com/ Retrieve the index.html of `www.lycos.com', showing the original server headers: wget -S http://www.lycos.com/ Save the server headers with the file: wget -s http://www.lycos.com/ more index.html Retrieve the first two levels of `wuarchive.wustl.edu', saving them to /tmp. wget -P/tmp -l2 ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/ You want to download all the GIFs from an HTTP directory. `wget http://host/dir/*.gif' doesn't work, since HTTP retrieval does not support globbing. In that case, use: wget -r -l1 --no-parent -A.gif http://host/dir/ It is a bit of a kludge, but it works. `-r -l1' means to retrieve recursively (See section Recursive Retrieval), with maximum depth of 1. `--no-parent' means that references to the parent directory are ignored (See section Directory-Based Limits), and `-A.gif' means to download only the GIF files. `-A \"*.gif\"' would have worked too. Suppose you were in the middle of downloading, when Wget was interrupted. Now you do not want to clobber the files already present. It would be: wget -nc -r http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/ If you want to encode your own username and password to HTTP or FTP, use the appropriate URL syntax (See section URL Format). wget ftp://hniksic:mypassword@jagor.srce.hr/.emacs If you do not like the default retrieval visualization (1K dots with 10 dots per cluster and 50 dots per line), you can customize it through dot settings (See section Wgetrc Commands). For example, many people like the \"binary\" style of retrieval, with 8K dots and 512K lines: wget --dot-style=binary ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/README You can experiment with other styles, like: wget --dot-style=mega ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/xemacs-20.4/xemacs-20.4.tar.gz wget --dot-style=micro http://fly.cc.fer.hr/ To make these settings permanent, put them in your `.wgetrc', as described before (See section Sample Wgetrc). Guru Usage If you wish Wget to keep a mirror of a page (or FTP subdirectories), use `--mirror' (`-m'), which is the shorthand for `-r -N'. You can put Wget in the crontab file asking it to recheck a site each Sunday: crontab 0 0 * * 0 wget --mirror ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/ -o /home/me/weeklog You may wish to do the same with someone's home page. But you do not want to download all those images--you're only interested in HTML. wget --mirror -A.html http://www.w3.org/ But what about mirroring the hosts networkologically close to you? It seems so awfully slow because of all that DNS resolving. Just use `-D' (See section Domain Acceptance). wget -rN -Dsrce.hr http://www.srce.hr/ Now Wget will correctly find out that `regoc.srce.hr' is the same as `www.srce.hr', but will not even take into consideration the link to `www.mit.edu'. You have a presentation and would like the dumb absolute links to be converted to relative? Use `-k': wget -k -r URL You would like the output documents to go to standard output instead of to files? OK, but Wget will automatically shut up (turn on `--quiet') to prevent mixing of Wget output and the retrieved documents. wget -O - http://jagor.srce.hr/ http://www.srce.hr/ You can also combine the two options and make weird pipelines to retrieve the documents from remote hotlists: wget -O - http://cool.list.com/ | wget --force-html -i - Go to the first, previous, next, last section, table of contents.

We inaugurate the new series with a report by John P. Wilkin that posits the scope of works in the public domain and probable extent of orphan works in our research library collections, based on an analysis of the HathiTrust book corpus. Wilkin is executive director of HathiTrust and is the Associate University Librarian for Library Information Technology for the University of Michigan. HathiTrust, a collaborative of more than fifty research libraries worldwide, is devoted to ensuring preservation of and access to the published cultural record. Feel free to leave comments in the announcement for this article on our facebook wall. PDF Version of Report (370 KB file) >> Bibliographic Indeterminacy and the Scale of Problems and Opportunities of \"Rights\" in Digital Collection Building by John P. Wilkin February 2011 The research library community has little strong or reliable data on the number of unique books in our collections and their \"rights\"\u0097for example, whether they are in the public domain or in-copyright and, if in-copyright, whether they are orphan works. At its foundation, this problem is created by the dearth of reliable bibliographic information, or what I've been calling bibliographic indeterminacy. For example, we'd like to know how large the \"collective collection\" of all (or even just all North American) research libraries is, and how many unique volumes research libraries hold in aggregate; otherwise, there's no way to know the cost of digitizing or caring for these materials. We'd also like to have a better handle on the question of what's in the public domain and, by extension, what's in copyright. We'd like to know how many orphan works there are, or perhaps what proportion of the digitized content we have online is likely to be orphans. And while these questions and more are regularly part of the conversation around digital collection building, they're also relevant to more conventional library problems such as print storage and particularly shared print storage. We don't know what's in the collective collection. The fact is, we have little reliable data about most of these questions. There's been considerable speculation in the wake of the proposed Google Books settlement and even years before, when we first considered the probable shape of the growing digital collection or the opportunities in front of us. Our biggest impediment to getting a good bearing on questions of the size, nature and rights status of research library collections is the simple lack of an authoritative bibliography. Efforts to Date To answer these questions, we often turn to WorldCat, but its records are overwhelmed by the noise in WorldCat: the high number of unique records that represent variations in cataloging rather than separate manifestations of a work, non-book and non-journal material masquerading as books and journals, and items with incomplete or unreliable metadata. As a database, WorldCat is by far the best thing we have, but its purposes long ago shifted away from documenting the collective collection to facilitating discovery (as a data source for WorldCat.org). Brian Lavoie and Lorcan Dempsey worked through those challenges with admirable adroitness in their \"Beyond 1923: Characteristics of Potentially In-Copyright Print Books in Library Collections,\" providing the best picture of post-1923 book publishing. Still, their analysis is just as certainly hampered by the chaos of the WorldCat database. And while extraordinarily helpful, much of the focus of Lavoie's and Dempsey's work is on the aggregate database (i.e., everything that has been cataloged) and then to a limited extent on a few Google digitization partners. Dempsey's \"Libraries and the Long Tail: Some Thoughts About Libraries in the Network Age,\" which provides a picture of the shape of the collections of the first Google partners, is also worthy of note. One of the best pieces of analysis on the likely body of orphan works is \"580,388 Orphan Works -- Give or Take\" by Michael Cairns. Cairns does the best he can with the available data, relying significantly on publishing statistics as well as Lavoie's and Dempsey's analysis. The focus on publishing statistics highlights the fundamental problem caused by a lack of empirical data. Cairns relies on Bowker's publishing data when, in fact, libraries buy many works that are never described in these types of sources. It's likely that a sizable body of gray literature and even some scholarly literature (e.g., some monographs in series) skews the numbers and would create many opportunities for opening access to content. Moreover, because of the informal nature of the publishing process for these works, many more of them may be orphans. The numbers are indeed hard to pin down. For example, in another study, \"In From the Cold: An Assessment of the Scope of \u2018Orphan Works' and its Impact on the Delivery of Services to the Public,\" the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) estimated 503 UK institutions could hold in excess of 50 million orphan works. New Insights Through HathiTrust Over the past two years, HathiTrust, a partnership of major research libraries working together to ensure that the cultural record is preserved and accessible long into the future, has built a large and representative body of materials that gives us a much more reliable empirical window into a number of questions around books. By the end of October 2010, the collection contained digitized versions of slightly more than 5 million monographic volumes. Work by Constance Malpas, Roy Tennant, and others in RLG Research has demonstrated that the composition of the HathiTrust collection is remarkably representative of research library collections. Their data, much of it published in \"Cloud-sourcing Research Collections: Managing Print in the Mass-digitized Library Environment,\" by Constance Malpas, shows that the HathiTrust collection holds a growing percentage of titles that are also held by ARL libraries:\u00a0 the median rate of overlap between HathiTrust and an ARL library was 19% in June 2009, 31% in June 2010,\u00a0 and 33% in December 2010. The rate of overlap is fairly consistent across all ARLs, and grows in a fairly constant way (see Figure 1: Overlap between HathiTrust and ARL libraries). The composition of the collection, too, shows strong signs of representativeness. The HathiTrust collection contains more than 400 languages and, like so many ARLs, slightly fewer than 50% of the volumes are in English; as the collection grows, many bibliographic characteristics (e.g., language, period, subject) hold fairly constant. This large and representative collection, then, may hold the key to understanding the general parameters of some of the problems facing us. Fig. 1: Overlap between HathiTrust and ARL libraries Assuming the HathiTrust collection is representative or indicative, we've started to analyze it for characteristics to help us better understand the scope of the public domain, orphan works, and copyright challenges. Before beginning, I'd like to offer a frank apology about the US-centric analysis that follows. US copyright law affords us a relatively clear framework in which to understand these problems. The challenges I'll identify are not specific to readers in the United States, though the US-specific analysis also helps us understand the problems for readers in other countries as well. Distribution by Date The first and most basic piece of analysis identifies how the collection breaks out according to boundaries of US copyright determination in the United States. Understanding the publishing patterns in relation to the major markers in US legislation helps clarify some of the issues that we should address. Specifically, we want to have a clear sense of how the corpus breaks down in the following regard:\u00a0 works published before 1923, those published between 1923 and 1963, those published between 1964 and 1977, and those published after 1977. For US law and US users, we know that something approximating the following is true: All works published before 1923 can be treated as public domain for a US audience. US copyright law required a copyright notice and copyright renewal for US works published between 1923 and 1963. US copyright law required only copyright notice for US works published between 1964 and 1977. (Actually, works published until 1 March 1989 are in the public domain if published without notice and without subsequent registration within 5 years.) If the work was created after 1977 and published with notice, the work was afforded copyright protection for the life of the author plus 70 years. Thus, nearly all works created after 1977 will be given copyright protection for decades to come. There is considerable nuance and some tricky exceptions to all of these rules, which I won't try to supply here. Peter Hirtle's \"Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States\" and other sources provide a fuller picture. As shown in Figure 2, the distribution along these dates helps refine our sense of the certain and likely public domain. Currently, 21% of the HathiTrust book corpus was published before 1923, and another 21% was published between 1923 and 1963. These numbers both mirror and deviate from the Lavoie and Dempsey numbers based on the Google digitization partners:\u00a0 their numbers for pre-1923 were a lower 15%, though the 1923-1963 numbers were a similar 20%. The higher HathiTrust pre-1923 numbers might be explained by the focus of some partners on digitizing public domain works; nevertheless, most of the works digitized are from Michigan and California, both of which have digitized more comprehensively. (About 60% of Michigan's print collections are currently online in HathiTrust.) Fig. 2: Breakdown of HathiTrust book corpus by publication date Distribution of the Corpus by US and Non-US Publication Whether a work was published in the United States also has a bearing on its copyright status, specifically for US users. For the periods 1923-1963 and 1964-1977, a work published in the United States is subject to different rules of copyright status interpretation than works published outside the United States.[1] Though we might expect significant variation in the distribution of US versus non-US published work over the years, if only because of the relative growth of US publishing over this vast span of time, it's remarkably uniform in the HathiTrust collection. Applied to each of the four periods, the breakdown is as follows: Fig. 3: HathiTrust book corpus: US vs. non-US-published holdings Copyright Status Determination, Pre-1923 and 1923-1963 For the sake of this discussion, we will assume all pre-1923 books are in the public domain. This is, of course, an oversimplification and a very US-centric perspective, but I'd like to posit this for the sake of clarity in representing these numbers. The copyright status of books published in the United States between 1923-1963 cannot be assumed, and must be determined for each individual work. The University of Michigan was awarded a grant by the Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) to undertake large-scale and systematic work to determine the copyright status of works published in this period. Over the last two years, Michigan, in collaboration with several other partners, has amassed a large and compelling picture of the likelihood of a US work published in this period being in the public domain. Month after month, regardless of the source institution or the collection being digitized, the Copyright Review Management System (CRMS) staff find 55% of the 1923-1963 works in the corpus to be in the public domain, either because those works never received copyright protection when they were published, or because their initial copyright was not renewed. Mind you, this is with more than 100,000 titles having been reviewed, not some insignificant and skewed sample. We confirmed the reliability of this work by asking the Library of Congress Copyright Office to analyze a random sample of our determinations. Most of the works in the remaining 45% are in copyright, though in some cases staff could not make a determination without more data. Consequently, we have a well-defined picture of the copyright status of works first published in US during this period and found in research libraries: Fig. 4:\u00a0 HathiTrust book corpus: Copyright status of books published pre-1923 and US works published 1923-1963 Moving From \"Certainty\" to \"Speculation\":\u00a0 1923-1963 The data presented thus far come with a high degree of confidence, as they are based on large numbers of volumes or, in the case of the CRMS work, tens of thousands of determinations. Now, however, we enter the realm of speculation. Some of this speculation makes assumptions grounded in work that has been done elsewhere. For example, Carnegie Mellon University's project to secure rights for contemporary publications was unable to reach many rights holders to gain permission to use a work, and this was more likely to be the case for older works than for more recent works (Covey, \"Acquiring Copyright Permission to Digitize and Provide Open Access to Books\"). As Covey notes, \"We could not find the publishers of most of the books published between 1920 and 1930 and of almost half of the books published between 1940 and 1950. Publishers of more than a third of the books published from 1950 to 1960 and 1960 to 1970 could not be found\" (p. 19). Moreover, when a rights holder could be identified and an attempt was made to contact them, the CMU project received no response from 30-40% of the identifiable rights holders for works published during the periods 1930\u20131940 and 1970\u20131990; and no response from 20-30% of the rights holders from works published between 1940 and 1970. Based on the experience of Carnegie Mellon University, let's hypothesize the following, recognizing that more data are needed for each characterization: For non-US works published between 1923-1963, roughly 20% will be in the public domain (e.g., because the author died before 1941, as would be the case for determining public domain status for works published in countries like the US that has a term of life plus 70 years). I want to be clear that I have no basis for this assertion of how many authors died between 1923 and 1941\u0097it's a wild guess. For all works (i.e., both US and non-US works) published between 1923-1963, we will be able to contact only 10% of the authors, publishers, or heirs who hold rights. The remaining works published between 1923 and 1963, both US and non-US, (i.e., 35% in the United States and 70% outside of the United States) are \"orphan works,\" i.e., works in copyright where no rights holder can be identified or contacted. Fig. 5:\u00a0 HathiTrust book corpus: Public domain, in-copyright, and orphan works, pre-1923 and 1923-1963 Speculation Amplified:\u00a0 1964-1977 Through HathiTrust we've made a considerable effort to get a bearing on the public domain opportunity for US works published between 1923 and 1963, but we have absolutely no data on the copyright status of works published between 1964 and 1977. In this later period, rights holders were required only to affix a copyright notice on published works to secure protection; moreover, if they included a copyright notice, they were not required to renew. Rights holders between 1964-1977 were undoubtedly more likely to be aware of the requirements for copyright protection than rights holders in previous periods (if only because of the increased public and legislative attention to copyright), and the lack of an additional renewal requirement probably also means that more volumes are in-copyright. This means that the percentage of volumes in the public domain is likely to be much smaller. We can also speculate that because the materials are closer to being contemporary, we are more likely to be able to locate the rights holder than would be the case for older materials. The CMU data again note that \"Publishers of more than a third of the books published from 1950 to 1960 and 1960 to 1970 could not be found,\" and response rates for those who could be located were 20-30% (p. 19). My numbers for copyright status in the 1964-1977 period are just guesses. This is based on very little data because we have very little data to guide our speculation. Bear with me as I posit the following: 20% of US works published between 1964 and 1977 will be in the public domain. With very few exceptions, no works published outside of the United States will be in the public domain. Compared with the period 1923 and 1963, we are twice as likely to be able to identify and successfully contact authors, publishers, or heirs who hold rights for those works in copyright (i.e., 20%). The remaining works, both US and non-US, are \"orphan works\"\u0097works in copyright where no rights holder can be identified or contacted (i.e., 60% of US works and 80% of non-US works). Fig. 6:\u00a0 HathiTrust book corpus: Breakdown by US/non-US and rights status, pre-1923, 1923-1963 and 1964-1977 Guesses, Pure Guesses: 1978 to the Present If we had guesses and informed speculation for the periods before the present, we're clearly working without a net for 1978 to the present. There are copyright wrinkles here (e.g,. some governmental publications, both US and otherwise, and occasional cases where a work may be ineligible for copyright protection or is dedicated to the public domain), but in general we can say that everything published is in copyright. In most cases, the work will enter the public domain 70 years after the death of the author, but there are many cases where the period of coverage is longer (e.g., 95 years for some works of corporate authorship, a number that may actually be lower or higher depending on circumstances). Covey notes that most of the publishers for works in this period could be located, but only 30-40% responded to inquiries (p. 19).[2] For discussion only, let's assume that our ability to successfully contact authors, publishers, or heirs that hold rights will double again, reaching 40% of the works. Fig. 7:\u00a0 HathiTrust book corpus: Breakdown by US/non-US and rights status for all periods Conclusion Our data spotlight the likely scope of the public domain and the probable large role of orphans in our bibliographic landscape. The following are some key findings of our preliminary analysis: The percentage of public domain books in the collective collection\u0097not simply the current 5+ million books, but the collection as it expands\u0097is unlikely to grow to more than 33% of the total number of books we will put online. Using the numbers assembled here, the percentage of public domain materials, not including government documents, will be 28%. The body of orphan works\u0097works whose rights holders we cannot locate\u0097is likely to be extremely large, and perhaps the largest body of materials. If the guesses made here are right, 50% of the volumes will be orphan works. This 50% is comprised as follows:\u00a0 12.6% will come from the years 1923-1963, 13.6% from 1964-1977, and 23.8% from 1978 and years that follow. (The percentage of orphan works relative to all works decreases as time passes; the number of orphan works increases in more recent years because more works are published in later years.) Indeed, if this speculation is right, our incomplete collection today includes more 2.5 million orphan works, of which more than 800,000 are US orphans. The likely size of the corpus of in-copyright publications for which we are able to identify a known rights holder will be roughly the same size as, or slightly smaller than, the body of public domain materials. Again, using these speculative numbers, they may comprise as little as 22% of the total number of books. Even before we are finished digitizing our collections, the potential numbers are significant and surprising: more than 800,000 US orphans and nearly 2 million non-US orphans. There are two important conclusions to draw from this preliminary analysis. The first and most obvious is that we still need better data to understand the extent of the problems and opportunities. In the coming years, HathiTrust and its partners hope to gather more data on orphan works in various periods, and on the extent of the public domain in works published outside the United States. Making serious progress on the matter of orphan works, however, will probably depend on a policy framework that allows us to make use of those volumes. Nevertheless\u0097and this is critically important for those who wish to see reasonable uses made of digitized book content\u0097most of the publications we hold in our collections and put online are likely to be those we would consider orphan works, with no clearly identifiable or contactable rights holder. In nearly all cases, there is no economic harm to any person or organization in opening access to these in-copyright works, and there is a great loss in not providing access to them. Without an effective legal or policy framework that allows us to do so, a significant portion of our cultural heritage will be underused and undervalued. Notes [1] Although we attempt to segregate US works that may have also been published abroad in our automatic rights determination process, as in our copyright review process, the numbers here make no attempt to take simultaneous publication into account. [2] I include these numbers about a lack of response because of their possible bearing on the absence of copyright holders. Still, it should be noted, if a rights holder does not respond, it does not mean the rights holder does not exist. Acknowledgments Special thanks to Suzanne Chapman for the handsome graphics. Many people helped me clarify the points I'm making here. Friends with copyright knowledge, including Jack Bernard, Peter Hirtle, Melissa Levine and Anne Karle-Zenith were kind enough to set me straight on some points. Other friends immersed in these problems, including Constance Malpas, Jeremy York and Lynne Raughley, were generous with their feedback and corrections. About the Author John P.

Posted in March 15, 2011 \u00ac 9:45 pmh.adminNo Comments \u00bb Guys, yeast infections in men are very common nowadays. Dudes are not exempt from this kind of medical problem. \u00a0You most probably got your penis yeast infection by boning girls with your beer goggles on. Yeast may be transferred to your penis and start to develop in that area. Once the yeast begins to accumulate inside the tip of the penis, the penis begins to get inflamed. If you have discovered that you are suffering from the symptoms of penile yeast infection, I\u2019ve got a cure for that will have you cleared up within the next 24 hours. Consider yourself fortunate. Each remedy below is VERY effective. Before you learn the cure for a penile yeast infection, let\u2019s just take a moment to talk about how this whole problem happened to you. Although there are many different ways a guy can catch a penile yeast infection, there is one scenario that is most common. Bacterial yeast lives outside of a man\u2019s penis and when diets or hygienic conditions change, the amount of yeast can become the balance. This change in the balance, or what doctors call homeostasis, is called an overgrowth of Candida. Candida is the bacterium that causes infection yeast. This bacteria causes penile yeast infection. \u00a0A penile yeast infection is one form of Candida Yeast Infections. Uncategorized How To Check Yourself For Male Yeast Infection Symptoms Posted in March 15, 2011 \u00ac 9:35 pmh.adminNo Comments \u00bb Check yourself before you wreck yourself!\u00a0\u00a0 Check yourself for yeast infection symptoms!\u00a0 If you have a fiery red, burning, itchy, and swollen dick, you may have a penis yeast infection.\u00a0 When you piss if you get cottage cheese type shit coming out of your dick, it\u2019s not an STD, it may be an penis yeast infection. The reason I\u2019m not playing around is because I had a male yeast infection.\u00a0 I got my yeast infection from a girl I met at the auto show this past weekend.\u00a0 Yeast infections in men are common and\u00a0 you can get one from having sex.\u00a0 Even if you use a condom, your partner can give it to you if she has it and you share her towel.\u00a0\u00a0 This girl I met at the auto show was insanely hot and we kicked it, but apparently she didn\u2019t tell me she had a yeast infection because she gave it to me.\u00a0 So be carfeul and don\u2019t\u00a0 automatically think it\u2019s\u00a0 STD like me. \u00a0It is ordinary misconception that only women endure from yeast infections, but most men overlook or are unaware of the fact that men can also get these infections. The trouble is, most men have trouble recognizing the yeast infection symptoms and consequently don\u2019t even know that they have an infection. Once a man can diagnose himself as having a yeast infection, the treatment is a fairly easy procedure to cure it and get rid of it. Men also experience yeast infection symptoms, much like the ones that women go through. These symptoms consist of feelings of itchiness, tenderness, soreness or a burning sensation at the tip of the penis. There can also be a discharge of thick, milky white, with the consistency of cheese. In worse cases, the penis may also develop blisters. \u00a0Sometimes, men yeast infection symptoms may not be that quite obvious. Some symptoms are easy to overlook and may cause some difficulty to tell if you really are infected at all. The most obvious yeast infection symptoms would be external and quite visible. It can be characterized by reddish blotches or rash-like effect along the shaft and on the tip of the penis. You might also notice some subtle swelling of your genitals. In some cases, a white, translucent liquid might be excreted. That liquid may be very thick and white with a cottage cheese-like consistency. Discreet symptoms would be itching and irritation on your genitals, painful sexual intercourse and burning during urination. These yeast infection symptoms may be easily dismissed as a sign of having a leaky gut, a condition that itself still controversially and scientifically unsettled. Also, often times, the yeast infection you might be experiencing may be a sign of other more serious sexually transmitted diseases. The best recourse if you suspect of having male genital candidiasis is to go see a medical professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.

Social research institutions, think tanks, pressure groups, charities and professional associations have contributed to the debate alongside government opposition politicians and the media. Comment and analysis is found in a wide range of research reports, government consultation and policy papers, academic and trade journals and quality newspapers. Welfare Reform Digest aims to help social policy practitioners and researchers to keep up to date with this flood of literature. We systematically scan the quality press, the British Library's intake of social science books and government publications, and a wide range of trade and academic journals to identify relevant material. We then produce full bibliographic references with detailed abstracts to give both the flavour of the cut and thrust of the debate and an overview of the research literature. The first, pilot, issue covered material scanned from mid June to mid July 1998. The second issue comprised material scanned in March 1999, and new data is now added on a monthly basis. We hope you find Welfare Reform Digest helpful. After you have had a look at our data, please complete the feedback form below and email it to us.

Android, IDC predicts, will have 45.4% market share by that time, while BlackBerry will be at 13.7% and iOS at 15.3%.Symbian, recently dropped from Nokia\u2019s long-term plans, is predicted to drop to 0.2%, and Windows Phone 7 is predicted to grab an impressive 20.9% market share, which would propel it into second place by a large margin. It\u2019s definitely possible, but even though Microsoft\u2019s partnership with Nokia is a strong foundation for success, we can easily see bumps in the road (such as Nokia\u2019s integration of WP7 going slower than planned) that could impede such stellar growth for WP7.What do you think about these predictions by IDC? Can Windows Phone 7 reach second place on the market by 2015?

All of the phones will probably will probably gain from the removal of Symbian. If any are to suffer losses, it will probably be Blackberry http://openid.blogs.es/deimdos deimdosI look at that numbers and I cannot stop laughing LOL, I\u2019ll have to ask these guys about the lottery :P http://twitter.com/jnoche John KnightNumbers need to be looked at with the understanding Andoird is across too many different MFG\u2019s which cause fragmentation and user pain points. I know there is gripes about iOS being locked down, but there is the flip side argument that this provides a more stable environment for the user. I seriously doubt within the next 4 years iOS will not make some huge leaps and gain a much bigger market share then listed above. I think Android and iOS will be the 2 main dominent ones going forward. http://www.facebook.com/kiefert Robert J KiefertIf it were my opinion I\u2019d say Blackberry at the bottom. But again that\u2019s just my opinion I can\u2019t stand the devices.

Just compare the ads for droid (very techy) to apple (uber brand conscience) to windows (very layman). There is a huge market for the non-techy that want a smart phone that isnt all that. http://www.mysocialmania.com Steven WilsonIt is too early to predict numbers like this.

Blackberry has totally fallen behind. It\u2019s slow and it sucks. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they had less than 10% of the market. I think that iOS share will be higher though \u2013 probably near 25%.

Still, research libraries with a stake in that work said they were undeterred. They emphasized that widespread digital access is key to scholars' work, and reiterated their commitment to making as much material available to as many people as possible, whether or not the settlement is revived in some form. And they said they hoped the ruling, by Judge Denny Chin, would galvanize efforts to solve the vexing problem of orphan works, which are under copyright but whose rights-holders are unknown or unfindable. Some university librarians noted that the settlement's demise has scuttled, at least for the time being, the goal of low-cost library subscriptions to the enormous Google catalog. But they also raised hopes for a legislative solution that would sidestep the concerns about monopoly that the Google settlement raised. \"The decision does not dim our hope that a path can be found for public access to out-of-print works,\" the University of California Libraries said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Many academic fields are dependent on this cultural record, and its conversion to digital form is the necessary basis for future innovation in scholarship.\" The university's libraries have contributed more than three million books to Google's book-digitization project. California's statement reminded users that much of what's been digitized by Google and its research-library partners has become part of the HathiTrust Digital Library, a large-scale repository that draws on the collections of 52 partner institutions. That digitized material \"was obtained in large measure through the Google partnership,\" the California libraries said. \"Libraries are not leaving the future of digital books to Google,\" the HathiTrust Digital Library said in its own statement, posted on its Web site on Wednesday. \"HathiTrust will maintain our commitment to long-term digital preservation of library collections curated by generations of librarians at great research libraries around the world.\" HathiTrust said it would continue to provide \"full-text search of the repository\" as well as appropriate uses of in-copyright material. About 2.2 million of the repository's 8.4 million volumes are in the public domain and accessible on the Web; the rest are under copyright. All that will remain in HathiTrust regardless of what happens with the settlement, and their digitizing work continues. \"We will continue to strive to provide as much access as legally possible to materials in the repository for discovery, reading, and computational research,\" the trust said. John P. Wilkin, HathiTrust's executive director, said the ruling did not take the group by surprise, and that he expected Google would continue its digitization work. \"Judge Chin's analysis made sense,\" he said. \"It doesn't change what we're doing at all in HathiTrust.\" What does change, from the trust's perspective, is the chance to give more people access to the abundance of material scanned by Google and its partners. Mr. Wilkin talked about \"what might have been possible\" if the judge had approved the settlement. Low-rate library subscriptions to the Google corpus, for instance, could have put it within reach of people who can't easily find or read that material now. \"That was something that we fought hard to get into the settlement,\" Mr. Wilkin said. The Google library \"would have been an amazing treasure trove for people who don't have access everywhere. I think that's a real loss.\" Thinking of the Orphans In his ruling, Judge Chin said that clearing up the uncertainty over orphan works' status was best left to Congress rather than to private entities like Google. HathiTrust said it hoped that \"the rejection of the settlement will lead immediately to meaningful progress toward orphan-works legislation.\" There has been renewed talk about a coalition, maybe\u2014but not necessarily\u2014led by Google, to push for such legislation action. \"We would throw our weight behind that,\" Mr. Wilkin said. \"This has to be one of the outcomes\" of the case, he said: \"a legislative framework\u2014not just in the United States but around the world\u2014on orphan works.\" Orphan-works bills have been introduced over the past few years, most recently in 2008, but so far none has become law. The trust has been gathering data on just how big the orphan-works problem is, \"trying to get some bibliographic certainty\" on the problem, the executive director said. \"I don't think for many years to come that we're going to see a public-domain corpus of more than about 30 percent\" of the books available, he added. Having more data, he said, might encourage lawmakers to take action on the issue more quickly. Orphan works were also very much on the mind of Michael A. Keller, the Stanford University librarian, who released a statement about the ruling on Tuesday. \"Congress has considered watered-down solutions for access to these books for years, but only this project imagined universal widespread access to them,\" Mr. Keller said. He lamented that the decision \"leaves unanswered several important questions, including access to orphan works, periods of protection provided by the Copyright Law, and the yearning for a universal library available to all American citizens.\" As for what happens next, Mr. Keller said that the university is analyzing the ruling and would consult with Google and its other library partners before it decides how to proceed. An orphan-works bill isn't the only solution being proposed to put orphan works within reach of more users. The issue is likely to figure in the planning conversations surrounding the proposed Digital Public Library of America, for instance. An Alternative Remedy One strategy, extended collective licensing, or ECL, has been generating a lot of interest among librarians and copyright reformers, says Peter Brantley, director of the Internet Archive's BookServer project. He's also a co-founder of the Open Book Alliance, whose members include Amazon.com and Microsoft. (The alliance weighed in against the Google settlement, filing a brief opposing it in 2009.) The ECL approach works like this: Certain uses of copyrighted material\u2014research that does not have a commercial application, for instance\u2014might get a free pass, while more-commercial uses would trigger a licensing fee. The approach took off in Scandinavia, says Mr. Brantley, and has had some success in Europe. One big challenge, though, is how to create an entity\u2014ideally on the national level\u2014that would administer the system. That may be more easily done in Europe, where many countries are more accustomed to approaching such issues on a national level. It's possible that the Books Rights Registry Google created under the proposed settlement could be repurposed to do that, but that depends in large part on what Google decides to do, and the company's not saying yet. Mr. Brantley says he hoped the ruling stimulated discussion of how \"to create legislative frameworks that enable us to broaden access to materials whose rights status is uncertain.\" But he said that, as far as he knew, \"there have been no explicit approaches on the Hill to enlist support for a new proposal. It's too early in the process for that.\" Prue Adler, associate executive director of the Association of Research Libraries, said the association's members \"are really hungry for understanding\" of the ruling and what it means. The association has asked Jonathan Band, a copyright expert, to analyze the decision and write a guide for the group's members explaining it and what may lie ahead. The association did not take a pro or con stance on the proposed settlement. Along with the American Library Association and the Association of College and Research Libraries, it did raise privacy and antitrust concerns about it and questioned whether academic libraries' interests were adequately represented. As for action on the legislative front, \"the library community worked long and hard for a constructive and practical orphan-works bill\" in recent years, Ms. Adler said, but those efforts were unsuccessful.

Subscribe via RSS Home Sitemap Contact Visual Basic Programmer Positions 28Mar/110 Visual Basic Jobs In Nj It is likely that an autistic boy who is in the general education does not require special education, which means it is unlikely that obvious learning difficulties. But that they still have special needs. The first thing a teacher should do is talk with other members of staff and the SENCO at his school. Sure that everyone understands what is autism and who are aware of how this will affect the child's behavior. Sometimes it is useful to explain to others children in the class about autism. This will help prepare them for the autistic child to school. It will be helpful to explain that the new member of the class may act differently or strange - for example, can cry or laugh unexpectedly inappropriate things. You must explain that although the autistic child may act inappropriately it is not intentional and they too have feelings like everyone else. This is an important thing to highlight, as it will be very easy for the autistic child to be in the center teasing, harassment and derision, if the other kids in class and school do not understand the autistic child's behavior and gestures. Probably a task that should performed before the autistic child begins in the classroom is to take note of all the classroom accommodations. Autism accommodations to consider: Make a note of the special needs of autistic children by example to go to the bathroom, with autism going to the bathroom can be a problem, find out how the child faces this and if necessary add signs at the bathroom, (small graphics cards with text) to avoid embarrassment and allow the child autism to identify the bathroom. Ask parents for a meeting and try to identify strengths and weaknesses of the autistic child. You can build on the strengths and encourage them. Sometimes it may be necessary to appoint a helper (LSA) or classroom assistant to help the autistic child in the classroom. The role Assistant autistic child should be to encourage the child to be more independent, work on the task and to mix with other children. Is probably mostly the beginning to keep an eye on the child at recess and during recess, when they could spend much time on their own. Autistic children tend to prefer as their own company, however older children and teens may feel left out or alone. Sometimes it may be useful to the structure of the breaks to avoid any problems. Try and avoid metaphorical speech, for example, \"Wait a minute\", autistic children tend to be very literal and will not understand. Avoid sarcastic language, or names of exaggeration, and nick, so when you are talking to the child and the whole class. Always be aware of what you are saying and how it might be misinterpreted by the child. You may need you to repeat during classes and maintain control of the autistic child is still listening, their ability care can be short, especially when something is of interest to them. When you're talking to a group, make sure you have the attention the child. especially young children can not understand that are included in the group, which may have to include talking to them directly, ie with only say his name or talk first, then the whole class. Like hearing a foreign language or something that they really have no interest in, all tend to close to it. A child with autism is no different, as soon as a couple of sentences go over her head off for their ears and stop listening to return to their own world. Try using visual aids in teaching a subject that requires abstract thinking. You might be able to use photographs and images to help maintain attention the autistic child. Even in high school, it is still possible to use visual aids for example illustrations or diagrams could be added to sheets calculation. visual schedules are used with great success, the autistic child can recognize what is happening as a visual indication of the different different times of day, as times of rest, recreation, physical education classes, etc Hometime You may want to include time for the fourth bathroom because this is a confusing time for most children with autism. You may also want to think about the use of social stories for autism a tool to help the autistic child keep on task and understand what is expected of them throughout the day and what to expect of others. stories social autism used to great effect in the classroom and may be as a favorite friend to an autistic child, and a master! Used in conjunction with a visual timetable and plan established behavior, autism social stories will become invaluable. A good source of social history is the Old Testament or, alternatively, you can get autism social stories online at http://www.autismsocialstories.com/school for school-related social skills stories, all different social stories visit their site stocked social histories.

Phone interviews are often used to screen candidates in order to narrow the pool of applicants who will be invited for in-person interviews. They are also used as way to minimize the expenses involved in interviewing out-of-town candidates. While you're actively job searching, it's important to be prepared for a phone interview on a moment's notice. You never know when a recruiter or a networking contact might call and ask if you have a few minutes to talk. Review these tips, then take a look at our phone interview tips video for more advice on how to pull off your phone interview without a hitch. Be Prepared to Interview Prepare for a phone interview just as you would for a regular interview. Compile a list of your strengths and weaknesses, as well as a list of answers to typical phone interview questions. In addition, plan on being prepared for a phone conversation about your background and skills. Keep your resume in clear view, on the top of your desk, or tape it to the wall near the phone, so it's at your fingertips when you need to answer questions. Have a short list of your accomplishments available to review. Have a pen and paper handy for note taking. Turn call-waiting off so your call isn't interrupted. If the time isn't convenient, ask if you could talk at another time and suggest some alternatives. Clear the room - evict the kids and the pets. Turn off the stereo and the TV. Close the door. Unless you're sure your cell phone service is going to be perfect, consider using a landline rather than your cell phone to avoid a dropped call or static on the line. Practice Interviewing Talking on the phone isn't as easy as it seems. I've always found it's helpful to practice. Have a friend or family member conduct a mock interview and tape record it so you can see how you sound over the phone. Any cassette recorder will work. You'll be able to hear your \"ums\" and \"uhs\" and \"okays\" and you can practice reducing them from your conversational speech. Also rehearse answers to those typical questions you'll be asked. During the Phone Interview Don't smoke, chew gum, eat, or drink. Do keep a glass of water handy, in case you need to wet your mouth. Smile. Smiling will project a positive image to the listener and will change the tone of your voice. Speak slowly and enunciate clearly. Use the person's title (Mr. or Ms. and their last name.) Only use a first name if they ask you to. Don't interrupt the interviewer. Take your time - it's perfectly acceptable to take a moment or two to collect your thoughts. Give short answers. Remember your goal is to set-up a face-to-face interview. After you thank the interviewer ask if it would be possible to meet in person. After the Interview: Take notes about what you were asked and how you answered. Remember to say \"thank you.\" Follow with a thank you note which reiterates your interest in the job. More Interview Tips: Phone Interview Etiquette Phone interview etiquette is just as important as in-person job interview etiquette when it comes to getting hired. That's because, regardless of how you interview, a sucessful interview will get you to the next stage of the hiring process. Phone Interview Questions and Answers It's important take time to review the typical phone interview questions you'll be asked and to prepare answers. In addition, plan on being prepared for a phone conversation about your background and skills. Phone Interview Questions to Ask When you are invited for a phone interview, in addition to reviewing the typical phone interview questions you'll be asked, it's important to have a list of questions ready to ask the interviewer. Dressing for Success Dress your best for an interview, regardless of the dress code at the organization. If you're in doubt about what to wear, it is best to err on the side of conservatism. Interview Attire From suits to socks - everything you need to project a tip-to-toe professional image. Interview Etiquette Interviews are often stressful - even for job seekers who have interviewed many times. Interviewing can be even more stressful when you are expected to eat and talk at the same time. Here's how to survive a lunch or dinner interview. Interview Questions and Answers The key to successful interviewing is to review these typical interview questions and prepare your answers. Also be ready with questions for the interviewer - here's a list. Winning Interview Skills So, you\u2019ve landed an interview for a seemingly wonderful job! Now what?

Cue a look at some of our favourite curious creatures of recent years\u2026 Buddy the woolly Mangalitza pig at Tropical Wings zoo in Essex. Manuka: Micro pig in the city Manuka with owner Jane in a London taxi cab Micro pigs are almost pass\u00e9 now, such is the fate of the celebrity pet craze du jour. But who can refrain from stopping, staring and simply sighing with joy at the picture of extreme cuteness that is little Manuka on her big day out, no matter how many times they see it? World's largest rodent Caplin Rous the capybara: Check out the size of those hands From ickle oddities to house-sized hamsters (almost) \u2013 Caplin Rous the capybara is so big he has his own blog, a Facebook page and a Twitter stream. Weighing a hundred pounds, the big pig-alike has the enviable title of the world's largest rodent. Don't fancy bumping into that one down a dark alley\u2026 Tiger+lion= tigon Hercules the... liger: why the big paws? You may remember Hercules the liger who, measuring 12 feet long and weighing over 900 pounds, has a whole page devoted to him in the Guinness Book of World Records. But check out our tigon \u2013 the cross-bred beast you get when a male tiger gets jiggy with a lioness (the liger is the result of a love-in between a male lion and a tigress, fact fans). Albino gorilla Copo de Nieve (Snowflake) was Barcelona zoo's only albino gorilla Say hello to 40-year-old albino gorilla Copo de Nieve (it means 'snowflake' in Spanish\u2026 see what they did there?). The most popular resident of Barcelona Zoo, he drew thousands of visitors keen to say goodbye in 2003 when it emerged he was dying. After suffering from an unusual form of skin cancer, he was put down in November 2003. Baby zenkey Japan's baby zenkey snuggles up to his donkey mum. Cross a donkey mummy with a zebra daddy and what do you get? This male baby zenkey, that's what! Nasu Safari Park in Japan is the home of this stripey phenomenon, believed to be the world's only living zenkey when he was papped here snuggling up to his mum in 2003. Olympic pigs Midget porkies paddle their way to glory in the Pig Olympics They're pigs, but not just any pigs\u2026 they're midget pigs swimming in China's Pig Olympics! They may not have a patch on Manuka in the cuteness stakes, but this midget species from Thailand showed off a mean breast stroke in Shanghai in 2005. source Save And Share : Loading... 0 comments Post a Comment Older Post Home Subscribe to: Post Comments (Atom) Loading...
